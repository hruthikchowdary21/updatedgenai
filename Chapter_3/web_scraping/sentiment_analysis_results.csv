Thought the first one sucked and like they were trying too hard.. . No intention of watching the second .. . I feel it&#39;s a production driven by greed and ego.. .

"Basically Hollywood couldn&#39;t have a movie about man losing his mind and fighting back due to negligence which is happening every day in society today, the male suicide rate is skyrocketed over the past few years and you hear nothing about it on the news so obviously Hollywood was going to destroy this movies legacy and turn Joker back into a push over because the first movie was empowering for the neglected men in society, makes me sick that men can&#39;t even have something as simple as a movie, Hollywood has this idea that the only way to empower women is to somehow put men down and they wonder why people don&#39;t give af about the garbage they make because men and women don&#39;t want to see shit like that only the hateful woke who wants to drive a message down your throats.",-0.0911998132586368,Negative

Love your content . I must just say that indeed this film was a disaster from a script and director point of view . but as crew on films myself I can say that technically is was amazing as far as lighting and camera along with edit and acting . such a shame for the crew to be involved in a film that is slated so bad without a breakdown of why it was so bad . well done film crew and cast and shame on the director and scrip .,-0.02499999999999994,Negative

"Here‚Äôs the paradox. For the box office figures to be so low it means many people decided not to go and watch it. This means that their decision was made based on other peoples opinions. There was a huge deluge of negative reviews online. It soon became a pile on and the movie stood no chance. I did go to see it and, although it‚Äôs not as good as the first movie, it‚Äôs no where near as bad as these reviewers would have you believe. I actually think there are very interesting ideas in it. They could have made the movie everyone expected‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô escapes the law and creates havoc and continues to murder people he (and the audience) sees as awful‚Ä¶ the end. Instead they left Arthur facing real world consequences. I think the decision to bring Lady Gaga in and make it a semi musical was where it all went wrong. The first movie had its fan base amongst, let‚Äôs be honest, men. Especially those who could identify with how hard life was on Arthur. Musicals have always had more appeal with women and gay men. I believe this is why the backlash started way before anyone had even seen it. Straight men felt they‚Äôd had something taken away from them so they were determined to hate the sequel and would never watch it. That for me is a shame. It wasn‚Äôt great but it was at least interesting which is a rare quality indeed these days.",0.09107142857142857,Positive

I think Walsh is extremely limited as a film critic. He restricts his criticism to the narrative elements of the movie. The film was much more about mood and aesthetics. And in this it succeeds.

"The Empire Strikes Back is an exception. George Lucas did not plan out the whole Star Wars trilogy ahead of time, and before The Empire Strikes Back came out, there was a Star Wars novel called Splinter of the Mind&#39;s Eye, which focused on Luke and Leia. The plan was to make this a low budget sequel, and Han Solo and Chewbacca were left out because Harrison Ford had not yet signed a contract to appear in any sequels. But because Star Wars proved very successful and Harrison Ford eventually did sign on for sequels, we got the big budget The Empire Strikes Back. That said, most people who make sequels know better than to make the sequel a musical if the original movie was not itself a musical.

"There&#39;s a foundational element here.  Why was the first one so popular?  Good LORD what an awful movie that was.  I cannot believe I went to see it and sat through it.  I thought it was going to be a fresh take on the Joker, and it was alright.  Fresh cr@p. You started to feel bad for the character in the first movie, he had a bleak life and was bullied constantly.  The first part of the movie was good, where there is a glimmer of hope with a new girlfriend and a chance he may claw up to some level of normalcy.  I was thinking that something awful was going to happen to that girlfriend, and push the guy over the edge of madness and become the Joker.  But no, that intriguing storyline drops, as it was all just a dream!  He goes on being shoved around, murders some people, then kills a talk show guy on the air. No excitement, no suspense, nothing.   Riots ensue.  End of movie.  WTF?  What a POS that was.  Yet, it was some kind of hit.  One thing it shared with the Heath Ledger version that was annoying as well.  These origin stories are supposed to show how a character got to where they are.  In the Ledger film, one questions, how could an evil super-villain run a successful criminal enterprise using people from mental institutions, and stay one step ahead of the cops?  Why would he have any followers if he indiscriminately kills them?  In the previous Joaquin Phoenix Joker movie, how could a mental midget like this guy ever potentially get ANYWHERE as a master criminal?<br><br>So the producers of that dreck think, hey, we got something here.  And turn it into a musical.  Frankly, I am surprised it failed.  There were enough idiots (unfortunately I was an idiot to give it a try) to see the first one-<del>probably many people multiple times to get those kinds of numbers-</del> and loved the first one, why wouldn&#39;t this work?  <br><br>Jeez.

"I&#39;m a 58 year old with Aspergers Syndrome,  a form of a autism that is basically on the spectrum. I can&#39;t socialize very well and because of that,  I never married. One of the symptoms of Aspergers is that the person with Aspergers knows a lot about a single subject such as doorknobs,  washing machines or something people not on the spectrum find interesting such as music, art, sports or, like me, movies. The downside about obsessing over movies is that I never liked Quentin Tarantino because I saw the same movies that he did so I knew from the start that he was an artistic poacher. I used to respect his view about Ideology was going too far in Hollywood and leaving their imprints on modern film. He and I agree that the 80s was an artistic low point for movies and movies today are outdoing the 80s when it comes to lack of artistic integrity.  <br>Now, he backs Harris,  who is part of Ideology in cinema,  so I don&#39;t take Tarantino very seriously.  He also disrespected one of my favorite Horror films, &quot;Phantasm&quot;.

"It‚Äôs a masterpiece! &amp; I don‚Äôt think people are deep enough to truly appreciate it. Arthur fleck is Batman‚Äôs half brother &amp; Batman‚Äôs dad ironically created the inevitable real joker( the man who kills Arthur fleck). Arthur never experienced love , not from his mom or anyone, that sadness that loneliness and utter despair is the entire point. Arthur is a good person a victim , someone we all had empathy for in part 1 and throughout. He bottled up his emotions and trauma tried to laugh it off as his mom would try and have him do calling ‚Äúhappy‚Äù , but those emotions never went away , it could go to suicide or outward aggression and in part 1 he chose outward aggression. Something he is eventually remorseful for in part 2 . The Folie a deux is French for two crazy people delusional together . He‚Äôs delusional believing harley truly loves him for who he is as Arthur Fleck, and she‚Äôs delusional for loving the joker side of him even tho that‚Äôs not really him because he‚Äôs a good guy deep down inside because his true self is not the ‚Äújoker ‚Äú psychopath , and not even the real joker after all. The midget even said you were always good to me. It was Arthur‚Äôs redemption, to be honest and true self, but when he went searching for Harley the tragedy is she doesn‚Äôt love who he really is and Arthur ends up dying alone never experiencing love. Just when you feel good for him that he finally is being loved. Arthur doesn‚Äôt make the direct connection that maybe he could get fake love if he continues the fake self joker persona and is never presented that opportunity, maybe he would have kept being the joker just to please her if it meant he could be fake loved by Harley, maybe that would have caused him the anger he needed to turn into the real joker, we will never know. At the end of it that‚Äôs all Arthur ever wanted , love. When he sees Harley his make up is faded away as Arthur fleck this weak man who came out at closing statement emerges as his true vulnerable unattractive true self to Harley, that‚Äôs why she left him alone in the courtroom as she herself realizes in the end that it was all a fantasy &amp; he isn‚Äôt the joker, she studied to be a psychiatrist and realizes what he really is and leaves him &amp; turns him in to the cops. Arthur betrayed and symbolically shot by Harley in the stomach comes to fruition. In the end he is the origin story &amp; inspiration of the real joker , the guy who kills him in the end and cuts smile on his face in the background, which is the perhaps the Keith ledger Joker character who battles Batman not Arthur fleck. We all are him angry at the film angry at Arthur not giving him love and stabbing him to death. Even some happy he dies for being this weak man nobody loves. The musical aspect of the film is fitting since no singing occurs until he falls in fake love with lady Gaga, he never sings in his delusions prior to this, and he even sings in his real life in fitting and funny moments to his cell inmates. Singing is his delusional state feeling the perceived  notion of love that he truly never receives and I don‚Äôt mind the music since he‚Äôs crazy singing to himself most of the time. We are the audience that hates him for not being funny , the point of this film is not to like him for being weak and vulnerable, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt like it, Arthur fleck still not being loved. The film is deeper then we think and horrible if you come in to it with pre conceived notions of what you thought it should be. In due time I hope people appreciate the beauty of the film and don‚Äôt look at it through a superficial lens.",0.106377151799687,Positive

I have to admit that even after hearing the very title of the thing, maybe a year ago or whatever it was, I had my doubts. It sounded just a way bit too pretentious and just plain stupid. From the cartoon show beginning my worst fears were confirmed. Add in a series of pointless songs, and there are way too many of them in this film, plus a plot line that is almost non existent and you have what was a waste of two hours or so of my life. It really felt like a middle finger raised to the audience and what the makers of this were trying to achieve beats me.

"Haven‚Äôt seen it yet, but I suppose I could see Arthur having a change of heart.  Initially, he was just a troubled dude with laughter issues and a codependent relationship with his more troubled mother.  He was delusional, sad, and ignored by polite society.  He wasn‚Äôt even initially homicidal, as his first killings were (nearly) all self-defense.  <br><br>Not sure if he‚Äôs forced back onto his meds in the new one, but it seemed like he was far worse being OFF them in the original.  Medicating him heavily could definitely bring about the sense that he‚Äôd done wrong in the first movie because, again, he wasn‚Äôt a killer.  He was on ten (or more, don‚Äôt recall exactly) different meds in the first film, and then he‚Äôs just off them.  That‚Äôs a brain scramble that anyone would have trouble dealing with.  Again, not justifying the murders, just shedding light on the fact that there was the lonely, delusional Arthur and the homicidal Arthur.  The medicated and the unmedicated.  He carried the gun for protection after being jumped, not to use it randomly on unsuspecting or (in Arthur‚Äôs mind) undeserving pedestrians.<br><br>In a way, this story of a potential new Joker makes more sense because we never got the feeling that Arthur was a criminal mastermind.  Criminal, maybe, when he felt pushed enough to justify being one but not the genius of other iterations of Joker, so maybe it makes sense to have someone else take up the mantle, some chess genius loner who spent his youth reading The Art of War alongside biographies of famous comedians, someone who saw what Arthur really was, a not-too-bright loner who accidentally rallied a movement through acts of violence.  Now he imagines what Arthur COULD have been if he‚Äôd stayed the course.  But let‚Äôs face it: Arthur Fleck was not homicidal and didn‚Äôt even stand up for himself until certain events pushed him over the edge.  It was the origin story (IF his killer is not identified in part 2) of an idea.  Arthur Fleck is not who needs to live on, as he‚Äôs too sympathetic for much of the first film.  By the time Batman comes onto the scene, we could be on Joker number five, and no one‚Äôs the wiser of his identity (nor would they care, as it‚Äôs the plan more than the man).  Perhaps that‚Äôs why Todd Phillips set the first movie in the early 80s.  Arthur Fleck would be like 60 years old by the time Bruce Wayne dons the cape and cowl.  Whether living in abject poverty with his nutcase mother or living a middle class life with upstanding parents and the kid‚Äôs just a natural sociopath, it doesn‚Äôt truly matter where Joker comes from, which was a lot of complaints about the first film.  It‚Äôs what he represents.  That‚Äôs why his faceless supporters are important to the first movie.  No one knows who they are under the clown masks, just as they don‚Äôt know who Arthur is under the makeup.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=414"">6:54</a>",0.0632034632034632,Positive

I think Aliens would be an example of a good sequel that was never planned during the making of the original.,0.5375,Positive
"I don&#39;t think this is an intellectually good faith argument because it&#39;s very clear at the end of Joker 1, that the movie leaves on a cliff hanger. If someone doesn&#39;t plan on making more there is no cliffhanger. The movie exists in isolation and wraps up with a nice bow. It literally sets up the sequel in the last few minutes of the film. I only saw that first movie once so I don&#39;t remember the details exactly but I do remember very distinctly what was going to happen next because it&#39;s left wide open for  the narrative to expand. If Joker was to end there you don&#39;t show young Bruce Wayne (tons of implications there) and you don&#39;t show additionally conflict in his stay at Arkham Asylum. If you didn&#39;t have plans to make a sequel or don&#39;t want to lead your audience to believe there is the sequel than you don&#39;t write your narrative in a way that implies there will be a continuation. Showing young Bruce implies there will be a progression based on what we know of the character and he just commits a major crime at the end of the movie so yes that is is verified opening for more story. Maybe the director didn&#39;t plan another but his story beats provides the case for that reasoning which for the audience unless we are acting cynical also would come to the conclusion that there is more to come. In fact Todd Phillips had clearly expressed he wanted to make a universe in DC from the villains perspective in this art house type style so that again also implies this was the foundation for more stories like it.",0.16445652173913047,Positive

"This movie didn&#39;t give us what we wanted, but what it did accomplish was establishing The Joker as a true villain.<br><br>Even though Arthur Fleck killed people, he was way too sympathetic to be a true villain.

I left not wanting justice brought to Arthur Fleck, but justice FOR Arthur Fleck.<br><br>This movie left me hating Harley and &quot;The Joker&quot;. Even if it wasn&#39;t the intended direction, I think the only way to salvage this would be to extend the series into a true superhero series, and have this new Joker ultimately vanquished by Batman.",0.13512396694214876,Positive

"I saw this movie the day before the official opening and I didn&#39;t have this perception of it at all.  I viewed the ending as symbolic of Arthur realizing he had to say good bye to his original self forever if he wanted to continue in this world.  This idea coincides with the whole movie (to include the animation at the beginning), especially when Harley dumps him forever due to his lack of balls/continuation of Arthur.   I viewed the ending as a tragedy but not in the sense of Arthur being dead physically, but the fact that he really did want to exist as his original self, but had no choice but to kill that person to survive in the hell hole that is Gotham, and particularly Arkham.  <br><br>The other aspect I felt watching the movie was that just like Puddles and Murray didn&#39;t care for the way things went for them in the first film, the audience doesn&#39;t get to have exactly what they want or expect with the 2nd film.   Violence spawning violence type thing and it reminded me of the ending to Sopranos more than anything else. ¬†<br><br>It also seems to have become popular to double down on somebody else&#39;s opinion instead of actually watching the movie and focusing on it in its entirety.  Not unlike what we see in American politics today.  <br><br>Either way, I liked the movie and had zero issue spending two hours with my wife watching a FU--ING MOVIE.

Of course, we were all debriefed as to what was happening down there, and we all thought it was a terrible pity. It wasn&#39;t until I stepped off the boat and onto the savannah that I began to understand that perhaps the Rhodies had a point. He&#39;s come a long way, you know, the domestic subsaharan African; but there&#39;s something about seeing him in his own ancestral habitat that betrays his nature. The first native africans I met were a couple engaged in non-consensual coitus beneath a baobab tree; their screeches were so alarming that the whole camp had come out to make certain that a panther hadn&#39;t gotten into the horses. But no, it was this. Now, the Rhodies proceeded to do something in which I at first tried to intervene--hesitantly, I might add--but experience taught me it was fair to let them see it through. They snatched the offending fellow with lassos and dragged him off to this absolutely immense warehouse, or barn, as it were; a quite impressive structure, actually, and though I didn&#39;t follow them in, the noises that echoed out from it didn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. I remember saying, &quot;My God, it&#39;s been fifteen minutes, how long have they got left?&quot; and the Rhodie next to me said simply, &quot;Well gov, after they&#39;re done, it&#39;s my turn.&quot; I soon realized that the gentlemen who were gathered with me outside the warehouse door hadn&#39;t assembled for a bloody tribunal, they were all in line for a shag. Yes, some of those chaps were even UN. I suppose most men can&#39;t just go on holiday and keep their trousers up the whole bit. Regardless, the next morning, everyone acted as if nothing happened. I chanced upon the melanated fellow whose intercourse I had interrupted the night before, now crawling along the ground toward the sunset, leaving a wavering trail of excrement behind him. He was shaking from head to bloody bum. Suffice to say his criminal impulses had been indefinitely subdued.

Unfortunately, the film doesn&#39;t seem to have conveyed this idea very well.<br><br>Where the film failed is absolutely in its treatment of Flek. Whether or not it was an attack on the Fans is up for debate. But it was awful storytelling in either case. Flek didn&#39;t get where he was by process of reason and deliberation. He was driven there by a life of trauma. You don&#39;t just &quot;renounce&quot; psychological damage. Ask me how I know.

I&#39;m no fan of musicals, but love music and can dig a movie that riffs on music. A lot, potentially. Todd Phillips said in interviews &quot;It&#39;s not a musical, it uses music&quot; (I paraphrase). Spoiler alert: It&#39;s a musical. The tunes are well-chosen in terms of lyrical themes, but they&#39;re also used to try to cover up the fact that so little actually happens in the film, plot-wise. Frankly, it baffles me.<br><br>2. The key thing is that Matt has almost word-for-word expressed what I had to say to my partner after we&#39;d just seen the film. As I said to her: &quot;I feel like I&#39;m being punished for liking the first film so much.

And I like the second movie for not further glorifying violence and turning him into some clown version of George Floyd and actually posing deep moral questions.

"I believe Jocker 2 is as bad as a fart after Taco Tuesday but the entire storyline is safe. It would make more sense if you imagine for a second that the director of the movie is Tarantino... you know how that works don&#39;t you? The devil is in the detail of the timeline... if you watch the end of Jocker (the last scene after the night of anarchy in Gotham), he&#39;s in Arkaham with his psychiatrist and he kills her, you can tell by the blood on his footprints when he walks on the corridor. Well, if you count the number of people he killed that will make 7 (3 drunks on the train, 1 with the midget, 1 on TV, 1 mum, 1 psychiatrist) ... in Jocker 2 he&#39;s always acused of killing 5 (not counting his mum) so the entire Jocker In Brodway movie happens after Anarchy Night and before he ends in Arkaham with the psychiatrist. Conclusion, the entire story didn&#39;t happen at all, it was just something he imagined, same as his relationship with Sophie in the first movie. Another argument that supports this theory is that in Jocker In Brodway, he&#39;s not the psychopath maniac he was at the end of the first movie but the wimpy character he was at the beginning of the movie. Lastly, so you can sleep well tonight... where in the world a Supreme Court Judge will allow a maniac to defend himself wearing a clown costume??? he definitely imagined if not the whole story, 95% of it, probably he met Harley the first time he was transferred to Arkaham but that was all, and when he&#39;s stabbed at the end, it&#39;s when the story rolls back to reality and he starts laughing with the psychiatrist... laughing about how stupid would be to die that way after everything he did... that&#39;s why he says to her &quot;you wouldn&#39;t understand&quot; and kills her just because &quot;it&#39;s fun&quot; for him.",0.013888888888888895,Positive

If they&#39;d kept the original narrative of Harley Quinn as Joker&#39;s psychologist who he manages to manipulate into madness and used that as a stepping stone to becoming the Joker we all know, Joker 2 could&#39;ve been a really interesting film warranting a third part that brings in Batman and completes Fleck&#39;s evolution.

"Joker 2 sucked because it did the exact opposite of why people liked the first one and it was simply not needed.<br><br>The first one was a dark, gritty and realistic Scorcese-esque character study that effectively showed Arthur&#39;s gradual descent into madness on a relatively modest $70m budget. Here it turns into an overbudgeted two hour Lady Gaga music video and there is zero development in Arthur/Joker&#39;s character. What they should have done instead was show how evil Arthur has become by brainwashing Harley and abusing her...y&#39;know like in the comics.

"I honestly very much enjoyed this film. There‚Äôs no sugar-coating it- the film was an absolute tragedy. <br> If I found any fault with it, it was the running time. For what the film turned out to be, it‚Äôd have benefited tremendously by shaving a good chunk of fat off the entire project, but I could see it being otherwise tolerable in a setting you could pause it and take a breather.<br> Apart from that, it was an amazing film, accomplishing perfectly what it‚Äôd set out to accomplish; allowing the audience to submerge themselves right along with the glamorously horrifying moral descent of its protagonist/antagonist; the Clown Prince of Crime- the visually stunning, musically captivating aspects right along with the gut-wrenching, intolerably cruel realities of consequences. <br> <br> The film begins with a dark cartoon illustrating Arther‚Äôs grappling with the overwhelming shadow resulting from the many traumas he‚Äôs endured throughout his life that motivated him to ultimately commit six murders.<br> Joker, in contrast to Arther, signifies to the entire narrative and character structure the potential for Arther to finally garnish some positive feedback from a world where he‚Äôd only ever been abused or otherwise ignored. <br> In the first installment, we were taken- albeit horrifyingly willingly, if we‚Äôre being honest with ourselves- along with Joker to unleash a world of hurt on his victims in a storm of seemingly justifiable violence. I say ‚Äúseemingly‚Äù because while we all seemed to feel a sadistic release of angst at Joker‚Äôs dealing out vigilante justice upon the society who ‚Äúabandons you and treats you like trash‚Äù , the question we‚Äôre forced to confront in this installment is; can violence be justified? <br> The reason we‚Äôre confronted with this question is, quite unlike the first film, the world releases its seemingly justifiable violence back upon Arther, which will explain the terrible ratings and reviews we‚Äôre seeing pouring in for this film. Nobody wants to see the main character lose, and lose so badly. <br> The audience expected more of the same sadistic pleasure of watching a form of twisted justice doled out to characters who misbehave and mistreat poor Arther; having none of their backstories for what may have motivated them to be such undesirable humans. <br> In that regard, the audience does get the same film, but this time, they know the backstory of the film‚Äôs victim of violence, and rather than receiving sadistic pleasure from seeing terrible actions suffering consequences, we feel sympathy for the victim, and- understanding his history- lament the violence he suffers throughout. And his perpetrators feel justified in their treatment of him the way we‚Äôd felt justified of his treatment of the first film‚Äôs victims. <br><br> Throughout the entire run time, Arther struggles with accepting the consequences of his actions, and teeters between feeling fundamental remorse for his behavior or, otherwise, justifiable defiance at surrendering to his darker, sinister blood-lust. <br><br>  ‚ÄúJoker: Folie √† Deux‚Äù is, to summarize, a haunting masterpiece and a psychological riddle in the way it points a mirror back at the audience asking, ‚ÄúAre you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?‚Äù<br> We receive twice the violence as the original, twice the hurt, twice the glamour, twice the crazy- it‚Äôs a sequel more honoring to its predecessor than I‚Äôve ever personally experienced in cinema, worthy of a second look by a large margin of critics, and will go down as a cult classic in the likes of ‚ÄúA Clockwork Orange‚Äù or ‚ÄúRequiem for a Dream.‚Äù<br> Would I ever watch it again? Maybe. Once or twice. But I already know I‚Äôll never forget it. <br> As I started this review saying- the film was an absolute tragedy, but I think for what it was trying to be, it was successfully so, brilliantly so, and even a bit heartbreakingly so. <br> It‚Äôs not a comfortable watch, but if you go in knowing as much, you might appreciate it for what it is; a daringly unique and richly dark musical tragedy.

A Studio is investing a few hundred million in a movie, that property has to have some recognition by the public. They&#39;re more interested in their profit line than in entertaining.  Thus, you get sequels and such, nothing original, nothing new, and utterly predictable. It&#39;s so bad, the only way they can HOPE to keep your attention is by having explosions every 44 seconds.

And I think there was a lot to read in it, especially in the musical scenes and the courtroom scenes that people keep saying add nothing, I didn&#39;t think that at all, it&#39;s just you need to read the situation of the moments closer.<br><br>Now of course the first Joker had a rawness to it, and very dynamic with lots of things happening and interesting locations, and had a very emotional and ironic ending where Arthur finds the notoriety he wanted but only in completely losing himself. It was a really good movie... but had it&#39;s silly moments too, it wasn&#39;t a perfect movie. Neither was this sequel, especially since it&#39;s minimal location settings didn&#39;t make it feel like a bigger movie, which sequels usually are supposed to be. But I think the sequel&#39;s depiction of society on entertainment and media figures is so spot on: it&#39;s too much if you make it your entire identity, or combine it to be a political expression.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the film is a direct criticism to fans of the first film. That&#39;s too easy. It&#39;s definitely about how people want media figures in general to conform to what they desire, and you see that being done by multiple characters towards Arthur in the sequel. And Arthur is so desperate for attention that he&#39;ll do what he&#39;s told, but the moment he truly finds freedom, and that&#39;s in recognizing his wrongs and owning up to his faults, he loses the hearts of everyone who aren&#39;t willing to do the same. So they&#39;ll follow the next bloke who takes Arthur&#39;s place, because that&#39;s what happens: someone crazier on the internet does something silly and now they&#39;re the flavour of the month because they&#39;ll do what others wouldn&#39;t. The movie is a lot more thoughtful than what people take it for. It&#39;s not as whimsical for a musical ON PURPOSE, it&#39;s not romantic with Harley Quinn ON PURPOSE. I think it&#39;s decisions were thought out well and not a failed attempt at anything.<br><br>....... And the soundtrack is awesome.",0.10341880341880341,Positive

Take the minecraft movie trailer, the fact that it‚Äôs live action and jack black is playing Steve has gotten a big reaction out of people so they spread the word about the trailer. Do you know what we call that? Free advertisement. With the ever rising popularity of fandoms online, people would most likely go watch something that they are familiar with and can have an open ending discussion with rather than something that they‚Äôre not familiar with.

"&quot;Folie o Deux&quot; must be a double entandre for how making a part 2 to the successful &quot;Joker&quot; film was a fools errand and a mass delusion among the producers who thought they could force the original team to do it again. Everything about Joker 2  is about the rejection of the character Joker being able to outdo his first outing where he executed a man on live television, though they setup perfectly a scenario where he could; Joker&#39;s trial could have been something akin to Ted Bundy&#39;s trial, where he even fired his lawyer and represented himself. Had Arthur/Joker taken over the court house with his mob of Joker fans and broadcasted the execution of the judge and jury on live television then escaped, he would have become the &quot;Joker&quot; proper, with his gang of loyal thugs explained beautifully and his title as the clown prince of crime officially bequeathed. However instead of that payoff to the obvious setup, they instead decided to make Arthur reject his identity as the Joker and get shanked for it. What?",0.36092171717171717,Positive
