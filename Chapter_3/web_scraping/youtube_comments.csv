Joker Folie A Deux is a masterpiece!
Terminator 2 was better than Terminator according to most people. That was not planned. There is one example.
Next epic sequel. <br>Titanic 2
Aliens is one of the few.
Thought the first one sucked and like they were trying too hard.. . No intention of watching the second .. . I feel it&#39;s a production driven by greed and ego.. . Like when people say a famous person who&#39;s been famous for like 8/10 years.. they call the person a legend.. its comes from the same shallow BS place gross
"Basically Hollywood couldn&#39;t have a movie about man losing his mind and fighting back due to negligence which is happening every day in society today, the male suicide rate is skyrocketed over the past few years and you hear nothing about it on the news so obviously Hollywood was going to destroy this movies legacy and turn Joker back into a push over because the first movie was empowering for the neglected men in society, makes me sick that men can&#39;t even have something as simple as a movie, Hollywood has this idea that the only way to empower women is to somehow put men down and they wonder why people don&#39;t give af about the garbage they make because men and women don&#39;t want to see shit like that only the hateful woke who wants to drive a message down your throats."
I think acting part was brilliant but the story sucked
It‚Äôs certainly no masterpiece like Lady Ballers was.
Ok Matt sorry but I need to refute your point on all unplanned sequels. Here are a handful of unplanned sequels that are phenomenal <br><br>Aliens <br>Terminator 2<br>Friday the 13th Part 3/4<br>Halloween 2
spoiler alert joker2 was Spoiled üò¢
nothing beatsthe classic  batman
Aliens?<br>Terminator 2?
Idea was to make the Joker gay
Aliens
the movie SUCKS !!!!!!
I saw joker 2 &amp; Matt‚Äôs documentary in theatres üòä
I honest to God didn&#39;t get the memo it was a musical - man it was so so so bad
"For me, second Top Gun was just a tad better than the first, considering how much impact the first had on the audience. It was a first of its kind."
"Even the first one sucked, didnt even know this was coming out"
"lol, the word now is that it dropped 81%.  If catastrophic is the word for a 65% drop then what would be the correct description for an 81% drop?"
"I&#39;m really shocked that they haven&#39;t released a remake with an all female cast, that&#39;ll definitely bring in the bucks And if not, then you&#39;re not a harris supporter"
A musical joker movie? Like the 4th matrix? Thanks for saving me the time.
Boycott Hollywood.
I loved the first one but sadly I&#39;ve heard the second one is like a west end musical
Who cares.
"the audience response is to this movie, as harley quinn‚Äôs response is to arthur fleck."
THE FIRST JOKER SUCKED ALSO.<br>SECOND FAILING WAS TO BE EXPECTED
Fully expected Matt to find a way to like this film
Why the hec this guy does a film review? Like who cares what he thinks about firms. I remember this one from Joe Rogan or something similar üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Why the hell these scammers get involved with everything? Like Ben Shapiro who suddenly is even considered a smart person üòÇ.
"Joker 2<br>I enjoyed it immensely <br>on a MAXX screen last night <br>it pretty much says <br>that when you stop performing <br>miracles for the public,<br>when you stop entertaining <br>your prison guards <br>and the other prisoners,<br>they&#39;ll all arrange to <br>have you destroyed...<br>like Jesus Christ, Joan of Arc<br>and John Lennon<br>to those who say they disliked the &quot;musical&quot;,<br>well... too bad <br>if you can&#39;t appreciate <br>the imagination that went into that and the talent it took to produce it"
"Ever since this decade began, alot of movies have come out hating and alienating its audience, successful or otherwise."
"&quot;Musical for some reason&quot;...MW,  you&#39;re being obtuse. You&#39;re better than that.  I just saw the film.  It&#39;s stunning. It&#39;s sound and vision is mesmerising.  Joachim Phoenix is astonishing and outstanding, today&#39;s GOAT.  Lady Gaga is clearly multitalented."
"Who can&#39;t pronounce, &quot;Folie A Deux?&quot; I gave MW more credit but he mangled it, probably just to make his point.  Maybe it&#39;s an American thing.  Brits, Europeans, Australians, New Zealanders.. we can pronounce it."
"Woke is destroying hwood dn same it happening with bollywood lmaoo,, only 4-5 films are working gud on the box office lmaoo"
Did you watch it?
"Top gun Maverick was great, pretty sure that wasn‚Äôt planned"
"It takes great restraint and respect for the art to not make a sequel when the studios know it could make a lot of money. But if they can stop themselves, the original movies grow in status over time."
You don&#39;t know wtf you&#39;re talking about!
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a Joker 2. I didn‚Äôt watch 1.
"Lady Gaga turned it into an instant flop, long before they finished producing it. Feeling relieved to see I&#39;m not alone with the memory of [no way, i&#39;m never watching that!]."
Terminator 2 is probably an exception you&#39;re looking for. An 8 year gap would suggest the sequel wasn&#39;t planned.
"So the joker plays a joke on its audience no, that‚Äôs funny not"
Wayne&#39;s world sequal was good
It sucks fleck balls.
"Here&#39;s an original idea for you: what if the original Joker was actually a terrible, derivative, empty movie? Yeah. Kind of makes this whole sequel debacle seem silly doesn&#39;t it?"
I liked the first one and most likely would have watched part 2 until it leaked that it&#39;s a musical. That alone killed my interest
It is AMAZING!
"Everyone talks about going woke go broke, it seems like, in  this case, it was go non-woke go broke. üòÇüòÇ"
Top Gun: Maverick - an unplanned sequel that was better than the first. That&#39;s all I can think of.
this is perhaps the biggest failure both critically and financially since Cats (2019) ironically the same year Joker came out. Tom Hooper tanked his own career with such an arrogant and cynical effort. And now Todd Phillips has done the same to his career.
how is it even possible to fuck up a Joker movie? Like how did that manage to destroy this cashcow.
Most sequels suck though to be honest especially because we compare it the first movie.  You are taking away from the original Joker which I actually enjoyed. It is like when you read a book then go watch the movie.  The movie never can usually capture what the book does.
Apparently Jared Leto loved it. He was laughing throughout the whole thing.
How in the heck did it cost $190 million to make this movie?
The first one flat sucks too. It‚Äôs a typical liberal movie. The ultimate victim sympathizer celebrated while he‚Äôs committing murder and unspeakable evil.
Hated the first one. Complete bore.
I hope everyone forgets about this film and another Joker 2 comes.
surprised the critics hate it. but maybe they thought normal people would like it so they had to hate it.
"I have never seen so many people walk out when I saw it at the cinema. By the way, I think there are MANY sequels that surpass the original!"
Matt - it‚Äôs only Americans who can‚Äôt pronounce it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Folie √† Deux was a coup d&#39;etat
I didn‚Äôt see it bc it showed a woman helping a man realize his potential. We don‚Äôt need a woman for that.
"The first one was TRASH, who would watch a musical version? üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Home Alone 2. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was better than the original but it was of the same caliber and quality.
How the hell did this movie cost 190 billion dollars to produce and market?
Terminator 2!
10 Cloverfield Lane was a sequel to Cloverfield and it was better than the first
"I loved the first joker film.  I saw this as what it was, an attempted cash grab.  Also... that&#39;s definitely not Harley.   No interest whatsoever in seeing it."
Love your content . I must just say that indeed this film was a disaster from a script and director point of view . but as crew on films myself I can say that technically is was amazing as far as lighting and camera along with edit and acting . such a shame for the crew to be involved in a film that is slated so bad without a breakdown of why it was so bad . well done film crew and cast and shame on the director and scrip .
One example of a sequel being better than the original motion picture is ‚ÄúSuperman II‚Äù (1980).
Toy Story 2 AND 3 were excellent sequels.
"Here‚Äôs the paradox. For the box office figures to be so low it means many people decided not to go and watch it. This means that their decision was made based on other peoples opinions. There was a huge deluge of negative reviews online. It soon became a pile on and the movie stood no chance. I did go to see it and, although it‚Äôs not as good as the first movie, it‚Äôs no where near as bad as these reviewers would have you believe. I actually think there are very interesting ideas in it. They could have made the movie everyone expected‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô escapes the law and creates havoc and continues to murder people he (and the audience) sees as awful‚Ä¶ the end. Instead they left Arthur facing real world consequences. I think the decision to bring Lady Gaga in and make it a semi musical was where it all went wrong. The first movie had its fan base amongst, let‚Äôs be honest, men. Especially those who could identify with how hard life was on Arthur. Musicals have always had more appeal with women and gay men. I believe this is why the backlash started way before anyone had even seen it. Straight men felt they‚Äôd had something taken away from them so they were determined to hate the sequel and would never watch it. That for me is a shame. It wasn‚Äôt great but it was at least interesting which is a rare quality indeed these days."
Aliens? Terminator 2?
When you see a word &quot;Musical&quot; on the place where &quot;thriller&quot; has to be - please rest assured that will fail.
Shrek 2. Spider-Man 2.
My opinion is that it doesn‚Äôt matter to the people that finance the movie if it makes money or not as they are just using it to launder money
"Even the main actor, agrees with you Matt."
Lady Gaga made me not want to watch it.
Lady gaga ruined it
"Literally the first time I heard that there was a joker 2. Wow, I am a hermit"
I didn&#39;t see one single ad for the movie.  Strange.
My hope is that eventually actors just start turning down scripts that are influenced by leftists
"Shrek 2, the greatest sequel of all time"
I was ready to see it too
Aliens was a sequel and arguably the best of the franchise.
This thumbnail sums this guy up accurately.
I disagree Lady Gags os not a good actress. Lady Gaga did a good job in A Star is Born and should have done much better bettet job in her second film.
The drop was 81%!
"i cant be the first person to point this out, but it&#39;s very much the kind of thing the joker would do. Accidentally make a runaway success and bomb it on purpose because its funny to do so."
I think Walsh is extremely limited as a film critic. He restricts his criticism to the narrative elements of the movie. The film was much more about mood and aesthetics. And in this it succeeds. The story‚Äôs not great but it‚Äôs quite obvious that this was never the point for the film‚Äôs creators.
Did I watch the same movie? I don‚Äôt remember it ending that way. ü§î
Makes me appreciate Tarantino more and more....
"The Empire Strikes Back is an exception. George Lucas did not plan out the whole Star Wars trilogy ahead of time, and before The Empire Strikes Back came out, there was a Star Wars novel called Splinter of the Mind&#39;s Eye, which focused on Luke and Leia. The plan was to make this a low budget sequel, and Han Solo and Chewbacca were left out because Harrison Ford had not yet signed a contract to appear in any sequels. But because Star Wars proved very successful and Harrison Ford eventually did sign on for sequels, we got the big budget The Empire Strikes Back. That said, most people who make sequels know better than to make the sequel a musical if the original movie was not itself a musical. It is hard to imagine what could have led to such colossally bad decision making."
"Thanks to Deniro&#39;s weird rant send off, now hwood knows nobody wants anymore tds woke crap on the silver screen."
Sister Act 2 was better than Sister Act
We all knew this movie sucks cawk. Now do Terrifier 3! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Joker two was very nice movie. But nothing about class warfare. Just. Warning for The danger of being inspired by someone that blew up into violence due to class inequality.  <br>I think the wrong type of people got the wrong message from the last movie and ‚Äòthey‚Äô wanted to correct this.
And the Hollyweird&#39;s Best Picture award goes to...Joker 2!
"They gave us the warning that it was going to be a musical. Now, WB canceled batwoman because they watched a preview and knew it was going to suck. Did they not preview the Joker 2 before releasing it?"
Joker 2: Dropping a Duece
I disagree completely. I thought it was good and enjoyed every minute of it. And I wouldn‚Äôt call it a musical. The singing was very specific.
"Empire Strikes Back, Temple of Doom, Evil Dead 2...."
Most accurate review. üëçüëçüëç
Short Circuit 2 fits the bill!
"This movie should‚Äôve been called ‚ÄúLady Gaga‚Äôs musical and her Simp, The Joker‚Äù."
Margo Robbie is the only Harley Quinn for me.
Ace Ventura 2 wasn&#39;t planned and it&#39;s almost as or just as good as #1
"I expected  this movie to explain how  he went from  the Arthur ,of the 1st movie. To the Joker that gave Batman problems."
The first one sucked
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> Aliens. It wasn&#39;t planned in advance, and could be argued as being the best of all the films."
I didn&#39;t like the first one.
"Unplanned sequels on par with the first movie: Star Wars Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, Aliens, Star Trek 2 Wrath of Khan, Avatar Way of Water, Top Gun Maverick, Shrek 2, and From Russia with Love (James Bond). The list is longer if we include installments beyond the second movie in a franchise."
"I‚Äôm glad I learned that this was a ‚Äúmusical‚Äù before spending money on this, I can‚Äôt sit through any musical,  they‚Äôre just not for me, plus I don‚Äôt like lady Gaga at all, so no loss."
I think the film was great in a lot of ways. Overall a really great cinema experience
I haven&#39;t seen any ads promoting this movie.... i had no idea it was out......hmm. Wonder if the algorithms had something to do with it....
SMH what a waste
home alone 2!!!
Sequels not planned but better than first film : Aliens
Absolute nonsense!!
"Yeah I didn&#39;t want to see this movie because this Joker wasn&#39;t truly the Joker we know from the Batman DC Universe. Also, Todd Phillips had no plans whatsoever to do a sequel with this Arthur Fleck when he did the first film, so this was purely an attempted cash grab by Hollywood, and Todd Phillips decided then, &quot;Oh yeah, Arthur&#39;s not really the Joker too!&quot; <br><br>This movie deserves to bomb because it was made for all the wrong reasons! Hollywood can&#39;t think of anything new, so let&#39;s do a sequel for a movie the director has no vision for after the original, but let&#39;s pay him a ton of money to do it anyway, and the director was like &quot;OK, but I don&#39;t know what to do with my characters now, but I could care less if this movie fails because I got paid a ton of money to do this movie!&quot;"
I bought deadpool 3 and I watch it everyday. Theirs something special about it I can&#39;t explain.
Deadpool 1 2 3 exception
I can‚Äôt imagine Matt watching movies but it makes it even better when he gives movie reviews.
"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is, I think, the exception to your rule of &quot;movie made money, so now we need a bad sequel&quot;.  Also, arguably, Empire Strikes Back."
i&#39;m terrified to see what Gladiator 2 does to the reputation of the original!
I heard he gets a non consensual train ran on him in prison and he perma logged off after.
Hollywood is a great example of people being wrong and arrogant but they would rather burn everything down than ever admit it because they hate almost everyone anyway...I&#39;ve heard people act like that&#39;s a conspiracy when they&#39;ve openly said it for years on social media repeatedly lol....<br>A lot of the problem is college politics...by the time these kids graduate they&#39;re fully brainwashed by the incredibly liberally biased system that they really believe conservatives are their &quot;enemy&quot; even more so than foreign nations that hate us...and it&#39;s all for money and influence...
Lady Caca
It was a POS.
"Amazing how the fimmakers thought that making the sequel a musical was a good idea. Or maybe they knew it was a bad idea and did it anyway. Maybe they wanted the movie to be a flop. Hollywood used to be about telling stories and making money. Now it&#39;s about pushing agendas even if it means losing money, though I&#39;m not sure what agenda is being pushed with Joker 2. It&#39;s truly mind-boggling."
John Wick movies are uniformly excellent
"Terminator 2‚Ä¶. In response to your question <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=169"">2:49</a>"
Art the Clown is probably laughing at this movie.ü§°
Go watch ‚Äòterrifier 3‚Äô Matty. You‚Äôll love it
"this also ruins any re-watchability of the first movie. There is no more, &quot;what if?&quot; no wondering what ways this version of joker could have gone on to do what joker do. They definitely killed two movies with one turd on this one. Would have been much better to just leave it alone and let us have the &quot;what if&quot;"
Aliens is an excellent example of a good non planned sequel
Do you think James Cameron envisioned Terminator 2 when he was making Terminator? That may be the best sequel ever made.
"I understand why everybody hates it, but that musical thing and the bad story thing aso. is just a strawman. We all know the reason and I felt that punch in the gut, too."
It‚Äôs garbage. : It hated the people who‚Äôs watching it.
"I believe the box office may improve because of the hate watching. I had to see it to observe the Trainwreck. Didn&#39;t think it was horrible, but definitely at or slightly below average, which is really bad when you need a minimum A grade film because of the cash spent on this film."
"As soon as Lady Gaga was confirmed and they called it something Artsy fartsy and not just Joker 2, you knew it was going to be dog water."
"Rocky 2, and the Empire Strikes Back are both examples of continued stories that were better than the first and hadn&#39;t been planned until the success of the first forced a continuation."
"Yeah because empire strikes back was so terrible, get real."
Thanks Matt movies are too expensive to any time on . I appreciate the tip Joker 2 üëé
Well stated! Couldn&#39;t agree more!
"On a 190 budget , the film would need to make 380 just break even"
HBO s Pinguin is good
"Wow. So, so true! Great sequels are almost ALWAYS conceived of as a immediate continuation of the 1st film:<br><br>1) ROCKY 1 and 2<br><br>2) TERMINATOR 1 and 2<br><br>3) ALIEN and ALIENS<br><br>4) Godfather 1 and 2<br><br>Some clear exceptions are Dark Knight trilogy and Psycho 2. Psycho came out in 1960 and Psycho 2 came out in 1983 üòÄ"
"Joker was a brilliant ripoff/reimagining of an underrated Scorcese film called The King of Comedy. This was hardly a kept secret given Robert de Niro&#39;s inclusion, but I assume the audience was overwhelmibly ignorant of its source material. It&#39;s not surprising that Phillips couldn&#39;t pull this off twice in a row. Maybe there are failed treatments in which Arthur locks horns with the US Government and PanAm or becomes the next Dalai Lama and flees a Maoist invasion of Tibet... there just aren&#39;t that many Scorcese flicks to pilfer so seamlessly."
I avoid anything lady Gaga is involved with. She‚Äôs evil.
I‚Äôm waiting for it to come out on streaming
"Was Terminator 2 originally planned? If not, exhibit A."
"Well Rocky was hardly greenlit in the first place, in think it‚Äôs safe to say the sequels weren‚Äôt planned at all."
John Wick movies suck too
"I&#39;ve never watched the first one, didn&#39;t plan on watching this one either, but my son went to see it and he said it was horrible."
Wait‚Ä¶ so a super conservative political commentator doesn‚Äôt like a movie starring Lady Gaga? ü§î
Star Trek II is the outlier being a far better movie than the first or any after that of the series.
Aren&#39;t you supposed to be &quot;defeating&quot; mentally ill people in debates??  Isn&#39;t that how you make your living?
Would Toy Story 2 be a good example of being a good sequel born only because of the first movie&#39;s success?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=183"">3:03</a> exception to the rule of sequel: Aliens."
Tim Dillion ruined it!!  We wish him well. .  .  üôèüïä
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=183"">3:03</a> exception to the rule of great sequel: Terminator 2."
The number 1 key question the ask is; what ethnicity is Todd Phillips?? <br><br>It&#39;ll soon make sense if you look it up.
Joker was amazing. Why a sequel? There is no sequel
Musicals suck. No straight man wants to see a musical.
Especially woke musicals.  No thanks
I hate musicals
82% drop at this point I believe
Hi Matt. We agree !
It got a 85% drop.
"It‚Äôs content creators like YOU that has ruined the movie industry; telling people what to think and why, and it‚Äôs driven by making money. You make these videos to make money, so you are bloodsucking money from Hollywood and our cultures enjoyment of movies"
I am eager to see Matt&#39;s reaction to Terrifier 3
The movie is amazing and completely in sync with the first one.
Terminator 2 was successful
They don&#39;t think their audience is dumb and unsophisticated. They know damn well that they are. A huge segment of American citizens are some of the dumbest people in existence and they love this hollywod crap and think they are so smart and special when they like a film no one else does.
I went to the movies with my son to watch this movie and we walked out after 45 minutes.   It was unbearable and the singing...cringe.  It was awful.  At least we got to eat popcorn and nachos. <br>Why and how?  No clue.
The Hangover comes to mind as a movie that has good sequels despite probably not being planned from the beginning
Outlier is Top Gun Maverick.
"I don&#39;t think ALIENS was planned when Ridley Scott made ALIEN, was it? Yet it was a great sequel!"
"Matt is spot on. Sequels always suck unless they were planned as part of a series with the original movie. Sequels that happen just because the first film is successful always suck. Sequels that happen when the original move sucked, like Joker did, those ones really really suck."
"There&#39;s a foundational element here.  Why was the first one so popular?  Good LORD what an awful movie that was.  I cannot believe I went to see it and sat through it.  I thought it was going to be a fresh take on the Joker, and it was alright.  Fresh cr@p. You started to feel bad for the character in the first movie, he had a bleak life and was bullied constantly.  The first part of the movie was good, where there is a glimmer of hope with a new girlfriend and a chance he may claw up to some level of normalcy.  I was thinking that something awful was going to happen to that girlfriend, and push the guy over the edge of madness and become the Joker.  But no, that intriguing storyline drops, as it was all just a dream!  He goes on being shoved around, murders some people, then kills a talk show guy on the air. No excitement, no suspense, nothing.   Riots ensue.  End of movie.  WTF?  What a POS that was.  Yet, it was some kind of hit.  One thing it shared with the Heath Ledger version that was annoying as well.  These origin stories are supposed to show how a character got to where they are.  In the Ledger film, one questions, how could an evil super-villain run a successful criminal enterprise using people from mental institutions, and stay one step ahead of the cops?  Why would he have any followers if he indiscriminately kills them?  In the previous Joaquin Phoenix Joker movie, how could a mental midget like this guy ever potentially get ANYWHERE as a master criminal?<br><br>So the producers of that dreck think, hey, we got something here.  And turn it into a musical.  Frankly, I am surprised it failed.  There were enough idiots (unfortunately I was an idiot to give it a try) to see the first one-<del>probably many people multiple times to get those kinds of numbers-</del> and loved the first one, why wouldn&#39;t this work?  <br><br>Jeez.  I just gave up.  No more superhero movies for me, no more character origin films, no more at all, even if one comes out that seems intriguing."
Zombie Land 2
The first film was the conservative version the second film was the liberal version That&#39;s why it sucked
"I hate marvel and DC, so I block out everything related. I just rolled me eyes when I seen ANOTHER repeat marvel superhero."
"I never liked the first one either lol. I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>I guess it just ruins the Batman vibe for me by turning it into something else entirely. Like if it&#39;s a deep psycholigical thing ENTIRELY with none of the Batman fantasy, just make it separated from Batman and name it the Clown or something idk lol."
Road Warrior? That was one of the greatest sequels ever.
Texas Chainsaw Massacre- Next Generation was excellent.
Matt I completely agree with your assessment of how the movie industry views it audiences in general however I would further go on to say that their assumption is not without merit. As Exhibit A I present the whole Fast and Furious franchise.
there&#39;s a new joker movie? i had no idea. sounds like they&#39;ve completely run out of new ideas
"Joaquin Phoenix had not problem with Joker dying at the end of this, because it means nobody will come along and try to talk him into a 3rd movie!"
You should have just come on here and shit in a bucket if this was really an honest review.
"I saw the first movie and hated it, I was conned by the advertising that&#39;s why I went. There was no way I would even contemplate seeing the sequel. Perhaps I wasn&#39;t Robinson Crusoe and maybe many people like myself wouldn&#39;t dream of seeing it. Thanks for your critique on this movie, it sounds awful."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> Puss in boots 2 is one of the best family movies of all time.  The first was a stale and uninspired cashin."
It‚Äôs not folie a deux if Harley was just a fan girl and wasn‚Äôt even in the delusion. The Joker wasn‚Äôt swept up in the delusion either because he proved otherwise in the final court scene when he admits he‚Äôs just Arthur. They made Joker and Harley clowns which seemed like it‚Äôs intended purpose. I don‚Äôt think they completely missed the mark but Like Matt said ‚ÄúIt hates the people who are watching it‚Äù ‚ÄúThe people telling the story didn‚Äôt think it was worth telling‚Äù üéØ
How does this incel channel get in my timeline?  YT please stop promoting molestor vibe red pill losers
It was lousy. <br>Nothing like the first one at all. <br>Those are 2 hours of my life I&#39;ll never get back.
"Alien and aliens, one example I can‚Äôt think of."
Yes yes it was
Exception: Terminator 2
"Margo Robbie as Harley, I might check it out.  Gaga........Nope."
"Ah, a redistribution of wealth..."
Terminator 2 was a huge success. Pretty sure it wasnt planned
"De Zero is in it, don&#39;t need to watch."
"82% drop. Well, I hated the first one. So I am glad."
What a waste of resource!
It&#39;s a great movie. And it shows the only possible logical course of events. Those who hate it never understood the 1st movie.
"Todd Phillips intended a big &quot;f&amp;ck you&quot; to everyone, and he&#39;s getting a bigger one back."
Joker 2 is the sequel that nobody wanted. The fact that Lady Gaga is in the movie is a recipe for disaster. These are the reasons why Joker 2 sucked.
They gave you 2 Joker movies and NONE of them are actually about the Joker üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I wonder how much they paid lady gaga
"Oh, fuck the Joker. I&#39;m sick of seeing him. Batman has other villains to fight"
Aliens
"Back to the Future would be your example.  They never planned to make more than one, and while the second one did have a few hiccups as a result, overall, they were great.  One of my personal favorite movie trilogies of all time."
"terminator 2, Alines... 2 examples of not planned sequel that are awesome"
These were never Joker movies.
"What a joke! And you put a musician no, Lady Gaga, a plate of feces, in the movie! You are going to starveüòÇü§£"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=181"">3:01</a> Back to the Future 2 is an unintuative example. The ending of the first movie was actually done as a joke, but the movie was so successful that the studio demanded a sequel, so then the plans for the next 2 movies were laid down. I believe the creator said that if he&#39;d known there&#39;d be a sequel, he wouldn&#39;t have put Marty&#39;s girlfriend in the car at the end of the first one."
Folie √† deux is also a Fall out boy album
Bad boys 2 is the rare one.
Someone said that the joker got bum*ed at the end. Is that true?üòÆ
Did the fan that killed the Joker yell &quot;This is MAGA country!&quot; before he did it?
65%??<br><br>Haha. They wish. Try 82% üòÇ
Joker 2 sucks de la fucks
"I&#39;m at the point now where I don&#39;t care what Hollywood does, says, or makes. I could not care less."
"Terminator II and Aliens are examples of follow up that hold their own. So, if you wanna make a sequel perhaps call James Cameron."
"Rambo 2 was good, die hard 2 was good.... but yes the ball never bounces as high as the first bounce"
We&#39;ve seen this movie taxi driver
Aliens. Terminator 2.
Originally unplanned sequels that are great are not so hard to come by:<br>- T2<br>- Ghost Busters 2<br>- Aliens<br>- Toy Story 2<br>...
"I&#39;m a 58 year old with Aspergers Syndrome,  a form of a autism that is basically on the spectrum. I can&#39;t socialize very well and because of that,  I never married. One of the symptoms of Aspergers is that the person with Aspergers knows a lot about a single subject such as doorknobs,  washing machines or something people not on the spectrum find interesting such as music, art, sports or, like me, movies. The downside about obsessing over movies is that I never liked Quentin Tarantino because I saw the same movies that he did so I knew from the start that he was an artistic poacher. I used to respect his view about Ideology was going too far in Hollywood and leaving their imprints on modern film. He and I agree that the 80s was an artistic low point for movies and movies today are outdoing the 80s when it comes to lack of artistic integrity.  <br>Now, he backs Harris,  who is part of Ideology in cinema,  so I don&#39;t take Tarantino very seriously.  He also disrespected one of my favorite Horror films, &quot;Phantasm&quot;. On a brighter note, he won&#39;t make a movie about a tall man from another dimension,  who runs a funeral home and re-animates dead people to make them slaves in his home dimension. <br>When the screenwriters and actors were on strike,  I thought that the movie companies should have re-released older films so  that people could get to see &quot;Jaws&quot; , &quot;The Godfather &quot; or Ben-Hur on a big screen where they should be viewed."
American audiences can&#39;t handle a European approach to filmmaking
exception is the sonic movies
"Wasn‚Äôt a flop for me, I thought it was great. I welcomed a film which was different from the usual marvel/DC, people don‚Äôt like this film because it‚Äôs musical plain and simple. Performances were excellent in this movie and story is complex."
These days I only go watch movies that I either know that are somewhat good or that I want to support from some other reason if they are not that good. Marvel movies are No No and also any new Star Wars movies. So fuck you Disney. Also fuck you new Matrix makers.
Tim Dillon said it was garbage and he is in it
"Top Gun Maverick is an outlier, and is a great followup movie years after the fact."
"Matt, my partner works in the film industry. She 29, a second assistant editor working closely with someone who has 20 years experience - some of the biggest films in cinema. This WOKE push is killing the industry - AND PEOPLE&#39;S JOBS!!!!!! Rings of Power is so woke that people aren&#39;t watching it - as much as I agree it&#39;s unwatchable, I cannot see they will commission the 3rd series (or at least reduce the budget). This is costing a lot of peoples jobs! Same for KAOS. Again, awful story telling and unwatchable, turns out they are not commissioning the 2nd series. It&#39;s because they forced in a female director that obvisouly isn&#39;t good enough. That&#39;s 1000&#39;s of peoples jobs GONE!!!! WOKE BS must get cancelled in the movie industry. This needs to be spoken about how it&#39;s destroying peoples livelihood. It&#39;s the same for the gaming industry, with the majority of staff with blue hair and adding trans characters. This bs makes me so mad! Cannot believe our society has allowed a tiny minority of people to take over the entire entertainment industry and fill them with false realities. People walked out of the cinema in the Joker film - that was worst film i&#39;ve seen for a while."
Skip this and watch Terrifier 3 instead.
A good movie can be followed by a great movie. It does not seem to work the other way around.
Terminator 2
Aliens is an exception that rule you mentioned.
It wasn‚Äôt a dissaster<br>It just wasn‚Äôt great <br>And I think we all get confused thinking we will see the super heroes joker! Anyway
"It‚Äôs like seeing a beautiful, scrumptious cream cake in a magazine. I obtain all the ingredients, follow the prepping info,bake to same standard and Hey Ho!~ It‚Äôs absolute crap!"
The first 100 years of Hollywood were great.
"Hate to be that guy, but Terminator 2 was better than the first, and there was no plan for a sequel when making the first.  Only mentioning because Terminator 2 is amazing!"
82% drop.
The cast Lady Gaga and her monsters decided it&#39;s going to be the best film ever made and she&#39;ll get an Oscar. Serves you right. Joker is a villain. He&#39;s not a poor boy who got bullied and then killed. Justifying evil is what they do. These villains represent evil and wrong doings and criminality. They are not to be looked up to.
The amount of people that can&#39;t speak out some basic french words properly is shocking
"Short answer is, they made a damn musical. Like yeah, nerds love nothing more than a good old fashion musical, ah, NO. Sequels, we actually get."
An Expert on sequels he is not
Oh it was total üí©
"Exceptions to the &quot;unplanned sequels suck&quot; rule: Alien 2, Terminator 2, both JC movies."
"I didn&#39;t see the movie that way at all. It was a pretty good movie. - First off, the Joker doesn&#39;t die. He gets stabbed. That&#39;s it. Maybe he dies or maybe the guard comes looking for him and takes him to the hospital."
I think the problem is even tho they announced that the sequel will be musical they made sure the trailers were showing us a proper plotted movie instead of an actual musical-themed film.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=21"">0:21</a> wait lol Matt thinks they spent almost $400 mill JUST on marketing üòÇüòÇ what"
"The Joker was a funny, liked character in the Batman series, but these bitter Hollyweird liberals turn it into some kind of a psychotic loner freak,"
"It‚Äôs a joker was a funny fun like character in the Batman series, but these bitter Hollyweird liberals turn it into some kind of a psychotic loner  freak"
<b>Dune</b> ...Now THAT&#39;S a <b>movie</b> <b>!</b> <b>!</b>
"I have no clue the actual numbers, but as far as movies having <b>planned</b> sequels, Dune 2 (&amp; 3 for that matter, eventually) probably did amazing, as well as not having almost ANY &quot;woke&quot;/ghay crap. Dennis Villanueva, idk if he&#39;s actually a cool guy, I assume not, but he made a movie completely free from all that dumb sh*t that drags down EVERY other movie made in the last fkng DECADE, &amp; I hope audiences repaid him with resounding attendance in theaters &amp; rentals/streaming etc."
I love Trump and most right wing people but this guy is impossible to like haha idk why he just got recommended to me
The joker 2 is a joke
"I liked it. It was a cool alternate  timeline for joker, one where he can‚Äôt live up to the expectations of a ‚Äúcrime lord‚Äù. Every time he detaches from reality it‚Äôs a music number. I felt like it was a nice close to the first film, the insanity crescendos and the man who shanks joker takes on the persona, you can see him cutting up his own mouth behind Joker. It wasn‚Äôt the best but it also wasn‚Äôt the worst and I think a second watch is needed for most people. It‚Äôs all fun."
I guess Hollywood doesnt wanna make money anymore üôÑ if you make a good movie without lecturing messages and PC culture now.... you will make a shitload of money. Top Gun Maverick. Nuff said.
Joker 2...yawn....Zzzzzzzz
20 years from now people will look back and say &quot;joker 2 was ahead of it&#39;s time&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s not as bad as audiences thought&quot; just like other sequels like Halloween 3 or Nightmare on Elm Street 2 which got bad reviews when released
"Come on, Matt, don&#39;t be a party pooper! I really enjoyed the movie. I went to see it with a friend of mine who is visiting from Japan. We both really liked the movie. Two crazy people going back and forth in their own minds. I also like the music. I don&#39;t think this movie is for people who do not know the history of Joker. As a fan of Joker, I think it was a good movie. People who are really into the Joker and Harlequin would have enjoyed the movie.  Look, I am a big critic when it comes to Holywood stuffing up with comics characters. This time, it was a very enjoyable movie and I really enjoyed the take on the delusional singing fantasies. You are being too harsh."
"Glad to hear it&#39;s a flop.<br>F Hollywood!<br><br>I think MW needs to make his own superhero movie.  <br><br>Beard Man!     <br><br>Hey, i&#39;d buy a ticket to that!"
"If the fans never watched it,  did it ever exist ü§î"
Studio &quot;Todd you will make another Joker&quot; <br>Todd &quot;I&#39;ll do my best. üòâ&quot;
Greatest sequel of ALL TIME is Empire Strikes Back!!! Better than the original.
"The first one was good. I watched the second one on the seven seas because I wanted to see if it was as bad as they said. And it was. I don&#39;t know why they had to sing everything, only to find out that the whole movie has no meaning and he&#39;s still sitting in the asylum and daydreamed it, then have him get stabbed, and we know that isn&#39;t real either. So it makes no sense."
this is hollywood punching anyone who liked the original movie.
"If you take all the money Disney et al have lost the last 2 years, everyone needing money because of the hurricanes would be fine."
Home alone 2.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=300"">5:00</a> u skipped the part where Arthur was raep by the old geezer WHITE COPS"
to say spoiler alert halfway through the video and give us a second to decide if we still wanna watch the video we thought we were enjoying or abandon the video is a pretty horrible decision as a content creator...the title is my honest review...if u are going to include spoilers says spoilers in the title
Thanks for saving me the trouble.
All new movies suck. Oh wait..SISU was excellent.
"I think people are completely misinterpreting this film. It was more of an exposition of his mental state than it was a literal narrative film. The musical numbers showed us hus delusions about reality and his identity. The court room segment acts almost like a self realization in psychotherapy that he is, in fact, Arthur. The court room drama wasn&#39;t done as effectively as it should have been though. Nevertheless, I appreciated the artistic risks the movie took, and the fact that Phillips didn&#39;t just give us a recreation of the first film."
I wont watch either of the films. When I learned there was no Batman I was like: I‚Äôm out.
"You didn&#39;t mention: The Empire Strikes Back (sequel to Star Wars), Aliens (sequel to Alien), The Road Warrior (sequel to Mad Max), Star Trek 2 -The Wrath of Kahn (sequel to Star Trek - The Motion Picture).  These movies weren&#39;t actively (or at all) considered for production when the original movie was made but ended up being considered (by many) as equal or arguably better than the original. [Honorable mention: Terminator 2] Compared to how many movies and franchises, etc are out there this is an incredibly small amount."
The only way to save Joker is to make a Third movie trashing the 2nd one
"Terminator 2 is as good or better than the first one, no? I wonder if that one was planned from the beginning."
"At least Joker 2 is a real movie, to where your belief is imaginary."
First one sucked really hard. Can&#39;t even imagine this one.
Let me introduce the black swan of an unplanned sequel that&#39;s better than the original: Sing 2
One exception is the Hobbit - they had a plan from the beginning and ALL of the following films sucked üòÇüòÇ
Terminator 2 is an exception of unplanned sequal with breakout success.
Suck!
Joker 2: Fully a deuce
"An unplanned Sequel that was great.... The Empire Strikes Back, was not written until 1978 a year after the Original Star Wars (Later called A New Hope) was released in 1977."
"Bro few months ago you were trying to get back to reality when you played video games, but are here reviewing Joker 2ü§°"
The worst movie I have ever been silly enough to sit through. Horrendous!
One example of a good unplanned sequel that came out recently was Top Gun Maverick
"Couldn‚Äôt get through the first one, won‚Äôt bother with this one either."
The first one was horrible too.
You‚Äôre absolutely spot on with your criticism Mr.Walsh.
"Matt, this is where I completely disagree with you.  Police Academy 5 was way better than the first Police Academy.  Bob-cat Goldwaithe had an honesty and grit in that film that cant be denied"
The story is that Todd Phillips did this on purpose to stick it to the big wigs kinda like what they did for matrix 4. He made it bad on purpose because he didnt wanna make a sequel but the studio forced him. Because pt 1 made so much Money.
"There is a message in the movie. The thing is must of the people don&#39;t like it. Todd Philips represent the idealization of the &quot;Joker&quot; in this story. Harley Queen and the other clowns are the people that saw the first Joker film, missing or forgetting the point that the story was always about a broken man and his psycological process, not about a gloryfied clown prince of crime"
"I loved it... I don&#39;t understand what people expected... I loved the 1st one, I loved the 2nd one... Awesome storytelling, and the story of Arthur is very very sad!!"
"T2,Aliens,Top Gun Maverick in the conversation for not planned better sequels"
The first one was also terrible.
It was doomed from the beginning with Lady Gaga in it.
"Everyone knew it was coming...seems like most people TRIED to give it benefit of doubt, and everyone still hated it! How can they hear us harder üòÇ"
IT&#39;S A GOOD MOVIE. GOOD ACTING. WELL DONE. THE NEGATIVE STUFF IS UNTRUE. SEE FOR YOURSELF. A LITTLE MUSIC WILL NOT HURT YOU. üëç
Oct.13... and its at $165.3M WW.... not great but I&#39;m not sure the flop is worth this yt video being made.
"It‚Äôs a masterpiece! &amp; I don‚Äôt think people are deep enough to truly appreciate it. Arthur fleck is Batman‚Äôs half brother &amp; Batman‚Äôs dad ironically created the inevitable real joker( the man who kills Arthur fleck). Arthur never experienced love , not from his mom or anyone, that sadness that loneliness and utter despair is the entire point. Arthur is a good person a victim , someone we all had empathy for in part 1 and throughout. He bottled up his emotions and trauma tried to laugh it off as his mom would try and have him do calling ‚Äúhappy‚Äù , but those emotions never went away , it could go to suicide or outward aggression and in part 1 he chose outward aggression. Something he is eventually remorseful for in part 2 . The Folie a deux is French for two crazy people delusional together . He‚Äôs delusional believing harley truly loves him for who he is as Arthur Fleck, and she‚Äôs delusional for loving the joker side of him even tho that‚Äôs not really him because he‚Äôs a good guy deep down inside because his true self is not the ‚Äújoker ‚Äú psychopath , and not even the real joker after all. The midget even said you were always good to me. It was Arthur‚Äôs redemption, to be honest and true self, but when he went searching for Harley the tragedy is she doesn‚Äôt love who he really is and Arthur ends up dying alone never experiencing love. Just when you feel good for him that he finally is being loved. Arthur doesn‚Äôt make the direct connection that maybe he could get fake love if he continues the fake self joker persona and is never presented that opportunity, maybe he would have kept being the joker just to please her if it meant he could be fake loved by Harley, maybe that would have caused him the anger he needed to turn into the real joker, we will never know. At the end of it that‚Äôs all Arthur ever wanted , love. When he sees Harley his make up is faded away as Arthur fleck this weak man who came out at closing statement emerges as his true vulnerable unattractive true self to Harley, that‚Äôs why she left him alone in the courtroom as she herself realizes in the end that it was all a fantasy &amp; he isn‚Äôt the joker, she studied to be a psychiatrist and realizes what he really is and leaves him &amp; turns him in to the cops. Arthur betrayed and symbolically shot by Harley in the stomach comes to fruition. In the end he is the origin story &amp; inspiration of the real joker , the guy who kills him in the end and cuts smile on his face in the background, which is the perhaps the Keith ledger Joker character who battles Batman not Arthur fleck. We all are him angry at the film angry at Arthur not giving him love and stabbing him to death. Even some happy he dies for being this weak man nobody loves. The musical aspect of the film is fitting since no singing occurs until he falls in fake love with lady Gaga, he never sings in his delusions prior to this, and he even sings in his real life in fitting and funny moments to his cell inmates. Singing is his delusional state feeling the perceived  notion of love that he truly never receives and I don‚Äôt mind the music since he‚Äôs crazy singing to himself most of the time. We are the audience that hates him for not being funny , the point of this film is not to like him for being weak and vulnerable, that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt like it, Arthur fleck still not being loved. The film is deeper then we think and horrible if you come in to it with pre conceived notions of what you thought it should be. In due time I hope people appreciate the beauty of the film and don‚Äôt look at it through a superficial lens."
"I loved the movie , idk if it‚Äôs just that I like the psychological aspect of it and have empathy for Arthur fleck and understand it like Batman‚Äôs half brother story that inspires the real joker, thought it was good, delusion of being loved for his true self as Arthur when she was in love with his joker self. And we the audience are just as shallow as Harley Quinn not liking it for him not being the joker"
Why would anyone go to a political commentator for a movie review?
"The tumbler!! üòÖüòÖüòÖ<br>Are those ice cold, or hot years?<br>You rock ü§òüèªüòÅü§òüèª"
"don&#39;t worry.  there&#39;s a new &#39;summoning the devil&#39; movie out.  hollyweird loves death and evil.  they, in bragged fashion, show off their love for the devil, chaos, and anarchy."
I hope people stop seeing this iteration of the character as an inspiration to behave unhinged in public
At least the first film made a billion üòÇ
"Very, very disappointed in this film particularly after enjoying the first film immensely. I have to admit that even after hearing the very title of the thing, maybe a year ago or whatever it was, I had my doubts. It sounded just a way bit too pretentious and just plain stupid. From the cartoon show beginning my worst fears were confirmed. Add in a series of pointless songs, and there are way too many of them in this film, plus a plot line that is almost non existent and you have what was a waste of two hours or so of my life. It really felt like a middle finger raised to the audience and what the makers of this were trying to achieve beats me. If a third film is made I know I will not be going along to see it, the &quot;franchise&quot; has been killed off with this very underwhelming effort."
Joker 2 is exactly what I would expect from the schizo-narcissistic culture we have now. The last few years completely broke people&#39;s brains.
The sequel is a joke
"Terrifier 3 cost 2 mil to make and has already earned 18 mil in it&#39;s opening weekend, this with being released to theaters WITHOUT a rating by the MPAA and without major stars in it. 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. A true Cinderella story of indie horror filmmaking."
Watch Terrifier 3 instead. It is now the number one movie in America and has trounced The Joker.
Wait what does this have to do with being woke? Im seeing comments related to that
Termimator 2 is awesome!  I think its better than the original
That fact that Lady GaGa was in it kept me from seeing it.
Terminator 2
Bro saved me some üíµ
This was  a bigger FAILURE  than United States üá∫üá∏ border control in 2024.
<i>&quot;RIP Squid Game S2&quot;</i> - Matt Walsh
"The exception for unplanned sequels is definitely the Jurassic Park franchise.  The first movie pretty closely follows the book and then the rest of them are really just more of the same.<br><br>The trick of it is that dinosaurs eating people never gets old.  It‚Äôs classic it‚Äôs timeless. I will always want to see dinosaurs eating people.  Preferably greedy tax lawyers, but I‚Äôm OK with anyone that the movie has made me dislike."
"Wokism claimed another victim ü§Æü§Æ Why did Joaquin Phoenix even accept this shit in the first place? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23nogaga"">#NOGAGA</a>"
Back to the future is a rare example of an unplanned good sequel.
Has anyone liked it? They try hard to make shitty films‚Ä¶
Aliens is a great sequel that want planned when Alien was made. The rest of what you said about the movie is absolutely true.
"Its just your average French love story. Guy falls for chain smoking he/she, guy gets graped by prison guards, woman hates him, guy gets shanked in prison FIN. SPOILERS!"
Looks like killing Pepe the frog :-DDDD
Joker  was a garba... and this Joker musical  is worse
"How can we trust Rotten Tomatoes, considering the 84%-94% rating on Wakanda Forever? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
The pitch meeting video by Ryan George is amazing
"Terminator 2, Aliens, Maverick and Empire strikes back come to mind as excellent sequels. T2 arguably better than the first."
Am I the only one who likes it? Lol
As I understood it this film is a big f*ck you from Todd Philipps to everyone who wanted a sequel because he didn&#39;t want to make one...
Here‚Äôs how Joker 2‚Äôs ending COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER (my fanfic):<br><br>The courtroom explosion was actually caused by Harley&#39;s pyrotechnic obsession by lighting a car on fire. Then they escape to the infamous stairs only to have Harley pull out a gun and says ‚Äúonly I get to kill the joker‚Äù and shoots him in the stomach and he falls down the stairs. Then bringing the gun to her own head and the screen goes black. The end.<br><br>This emphasizes how sick and intertwined their obsession with each other was. I think this would have at least elevated the movie to ok status.
Terminator and Alien probably have the best sequels ever and not planned by the filmmaker so is chatting shit in that respect
Folie √† Deux is a well known expression is it not? It describes premeditated crimes committed by a couple.
"Lady Gaga is in the film, that‚Äôs enough for me, I won‚Äôt be watching."
All this guy does is shit on everything with an air of superiority
What do you mean &quot;Nobody like it?&quot;  The movie received a 33% Rotten Tomatoes score and a 32%  Popcornmeter score..  People actually liked it.
I actually watched the 1st one because Jordan Peterson raved about it.
"Joker folie a deux story Summary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFCeA5VlzPE"">https://youtu.be/NFCeA5VlzPE?si=D_O4LHTtVc7yIn_Z</a>"

Terminator 2 was better than the first movie but I can‚Äôt think of anything else.
Joker 2: Failure √† Deux
"Saw it yesterday. I liked it. If the first one was a character study, the sequel was a melancholy musical tragedy, starring our main character and his disturbed muse. Beautifully shot, well acted, that familiar uncomfortable tone throughout, and a handful of great moments of inappropriate-laughter -inducing dark humor. 8.5/10."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=181"">3:01</a> Blade Runner 2049. There&#39;s an outlier"
All marvel is boycott
"The Woker, dollop of poo."
Lady Gaga should give up acting.
Lady ga ga musical crap film
"Quite honestly, the Joker absolutely DID NOT need a sequel. Phoenix did an amazing job in the Joker and it was fantastic."
The best part of the movie was the cigar I had before watching the movie
"The Back To The Future sequels weren&#39;t planned, only after the first one."
"Never thought I&#39;d end up agreeing with the vast majority of what Matt Walsh is saying here. The only disagreement I have is the last part, where he said that the film industry is dying. The American film industry makes so much money that it isn&#39;t even funny, they just made about 2 billion dollars on Deadpool, Alien, and Beetlejuice 2, all over the summer. They can make 3 or 4 flops and then make it up with one blockbuster. The industry isn&#39;t going anywhere, anytime soon. Creativity and artistic innovation is what&#39;s dying, if not already in the grave."
Of course it will flop. Put Lady Gaga in anything to guarantee its failure
ü§Æ Lady Gaga is no Harley Quinn.
Hollywood lol ... theyre more focused on skin color and wokeness..
"Is this Matt&#39;s opinion, or that of his russian handlers? The movie sucks, but tenet media has lost all credibility. Sold out to a dictator."
"Meh, I liked it a lot."
"More often than not the more &quot;hype&quot; a movie gets, the worse the movie is."

Joker 2 is a clip show?
"If you&#39;re mad about this sequel, what will you now say about the forgettable matrix &#39;4&#39;?"
Don&#39;t worry Matt you can&#39;t ruin a movie for me that I&#39;ll never see
Think about the future Jack.
I wonder why Joaquin would not reject the script his acting reputation is so much better than this I love what he brings to a character he is the last of the great actors this script could not be saved even by him so sad
"Dont listen to the negative reviews. Joker 2 was Amazing<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXaBp-S2qWU"">https://youtu.be/jXaBp-S2qWU</a>"
"‚ö†Ô∏è Excuse me, but the musicals are not just &quot;sprinkled&quot; throughout the movie. The musicals are DROPPED at unexpected and unrelated moments in between dialogues. Some of them are not even spectacles, some of them are just acapella with no music and awkward dancing which looks exactly as if someone was singing and dancing to the music in their headphones. In their mind, it feels like they&#39;re immersed into the music, but the people around them are just looking at this crazy person singing and dancing to nothing. It became so annoying, that I rolled my eyes every time they were talking, and out of nowhere they just started singing. And the depressed voice of Arthur Fleck is not even appealing, so imagine him singing unrelated songs with no music and almost whispering the lyrics. <br><i>_________________________________________________</i><br>By the way, if you want to introduce feminist agenda into a Joker and Harley Quinn story, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense for Joker to manipulate Harley, since men are oppressive and tyrannical? Why is the female pulling the strings making her look like a villain?"

You should watch Terrifier 3 because it&#39;s doing extremely well. (Way better then &#39;am I a racist&#39;) but you would find a way to cry about it. &quot;ITz inSulTinG to C@thOLiCz&quot; or some bs to cry about

"It flopped for 3 reasons: It‚Äôs a musical, he gets gang raped, then murdered. The sequel is literally a big FU to the fans of the first film."
"Stop watching Hollywood, Europe does cinema better and has for years"
Nothing worse than a critic
The first one looked like a movie for thirteen year olds who think watching an R-rated comicbook movie makes them an adult.
"I feel as no one trys anymore to make real entertainment. I don&#39;t like watching movies I get really bored with them pretty quickly but I remember movies like robo cop, full metal jacket, Terminator, tremors all being really good today movies and videos games are just lame. I play videogames and I only really play fallout 3 and fallout new Vegas because all the games I try to play seems to me they lack anything that made older games good. Like good characters and being able to interact with the environment witch most games don&#39;t have any more. I really believe people as a whole just gotten lazy"
It&#39;s a great movie.
"For sequel films, not in the original vision that eclipsed the original--all I&#39;ve got are: <br>FP2: Beats of Rage, <br>Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid.<br>Both of those sequels basically built a whole new plot on top of the originals and the rest of their series basically followed the second movie more than the original."
"Haven‚Äôt seen it yet, but I suppose I could see Arthur having a change of heart.  Initially, he was just a troubled dude with laughter issues and a codependent relationship with his more troubled mother.  He was delusional, sad, and ignored by polite society.  He wasn‚Äôt even initially homicidal, as his first killings were (nearly) all self-defense.  <br><br>Not sure if he‚Äôs forced back onto his meds in the new one, but it seemed like he was far worse being OFF them in the original.  Medicating him heavily could definitely bring about the sense that he‚Äôd done wrong in the first movie because, again, he wasn‚Äôt a killer.  He was on ten (or more, don‚Äôt recall exactly) different meds in the first film, and then he‚Äôs just off them.  That‚Äôs a brain scramble that anyone would have trouble dealing with.  Again, not justifying the murders, just shedding light on the fact that there was the lonely, delusional Arthur and the homicidal Arthur.  The medicated and the unmedicated.  He carried the gun for protection after being jumped, not to use it randomly on unsuspecting or (in Arthur‚Äôs mind) undeserving pedestrians.<br><br>In a way, this story of a potential new Joker makes more sense because we never got the feeling that Arthur was a criminal mastermind.  Criminal, maybe, when he felt pushed enough to justify being one but not the genius of other iterations of Joker, so maybe it makes sense to have someone else take up the mantle, some chess genius loner who spent his youth reading The Art of War alongside biographies of famous comedians, someone who saw what Arthur really was, a not-too-bright loner who accidentally rallied a movement through acts of violence.  Now he imagines what Arthur COULD have been if he‚Äôd stayed the course.  But let‚Äôs face it: Arthur Fleck was not homicidal and didn‚Äôt even stand up for himself until certain events pushed him over the edge.  It was the origin story (IF his killer is not identified in part 2) of an idea.  Arthur Fleck is not who needs to live on, as he‚Äôs too sympathetic for much of the first film.  By the time Batman comes onto the scene, we could be on Joker number five, and no one‚Äôs the wiser of his identity (nor would they care, as it‚Äôs the plan more than the man).  Perhaps that‚Äôs why Todd Phillips set the first movie in the early 80s.  Arthur Fleck would be like 60 years old by the time Bruce Wayne dons the cape and cowl.  Whether living in abject poverty with his nutcase mother or living a middle class life with upstanding parents and the kid‚Äôs just a natural sociopath, it doesn‚Äôt truly matter where Joker comes from, which was a lot of complaints about the first film.  It‚Äôs what he represents.  That‚Äôs why his faceless supporters are important to the first movie.  No one knows who they are under the clown masks, just as they don‚Äôt know who Arthur is under the makeup.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=414"">6:54</a>"
The joker I remember from the comic world was crazy but also a mad genius‚Ä¶.could pull off master plans‚Ä¶Phoenix gets the crazy down pat but as a viewer I‚Äôm not buying his Joker could even plan a 7-11 heist.
"The guy smiles - There&#39;s a new Joker for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23iii"">#III</a>."
"No new ideas?!ü§Ø that‚Äôs certainly not true üòÇ what did you expect? A pink dolphin to come save him?<br><br>It‚Äôs still the same character, so there must be some continuity‚Ä¶ to make him fall in love and get a taste of parental responsibility, which could have been the shimmer of humanness that could have finally helped him climb out of his own misery, was quite genius in my opinion‚Ä¶<br><br>And I think the pointlessness you‚Äôre pointing to is basically the point of the Joker character.<br>Everything in his life was pointless, he was running in circles in his own head since he was a child. That pointlessness is probably what led him to commit all that pointless violence. And the film ending with revealing that he is not even THE joker, is the cherry on top of his pointlessness. <br>It‚Äôs simply a very tragic life story.<br>Except that on this movie there was that little shimmer of hope that he might be able to break that cycle of pointlessness‚Ä¶<br><br>And aside from the story. The creativity in the cinematography and the art direction is simply amazing!<br>And the singing was a lot better implemented than in Disney movies. A lot less repetitive, a lot more interesting songwriting and music. <br><br>I think it was just a matter of expectation. <br>That‚Äôs most certainly why they didn‚Äôt call it Joker 2.<br>If you look at it as a long post credit scene from the first movie, it‚Äôs amazing.<br><br>Just try to see it for what it is and appreciate all the creativity and mastery that all these amazing people put into it!<br>They didn‚Äôt think about milking a story, when they set up those lights, built those sets and slipped into the skins of those characters.<br><br>You can‚Äôt change your view of every film by looking at it like this, but with this one you can definitely do it!"
"Joker was a repudiation of cities and modern society. Joker 2 is &quot;No, he was wrong, he sorry. Be a good consumer.&quot;"
"Arthur really killed 5 people like they said in Joker 2 (3 guys, Randall and Tv guy)?<br><br>The trial talk about it, but idk why people don&#39;t get than Arthur really killed another one‚Ä¶ the psychology at the end of Joker 1.<br><br>Why that lady not appears in trial? Bc she wasn&#39;t killed yet. If you noticed, in that ‚Äú‚ÄúThat&#39;s Life‚Äù final scene, Arthur said ‚Äúyou cant get it‚Äù bc the joker jokes are so bad just like Joker 2; at the end of Joker 2, Arthur was killed to give born to Joker; and in that moment begin the ‚ÄúThat&#39;s Life‚Äù of Joker 1, who will be the Intro of Joker 3.<br><br>Why people don&#39;t get the 6 murdered? There&#39;s not 5,."
"I am not interested in seeing the new Joker.<br><br>Based on the described ending, it just created the endless Joker movies with someone picking up the mantle of the dead Joker, over and over and over again."
This is why Shakespeare didnt make sequels.
"Aliens is arguably such a case, of a sequel being better or as good as the original, while not having been planned from the begining. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back arguably was too. So it is definitely not impossible, the corporate forces at play just don&#39;t make it very favorable xDv It is not that Joker 2 tried the impossible and fail because it was impossible, no, it tried something difficult and failed because it was bad. &quot;Aim high, fail nobly&quot; did not apply here"
Top Gun Maverick is an exception.
Joker 2 : folly of fhaghots
"To me, Joker2 was a big downgrade from the first movie, but still wasnt awfull.<br>I feel that Joker1 was a great movie about mental health, but a poor movie about a DC character. It makes more sense if you seperate it from DC and take it on face value as a movie about a guy with mental health issues.<br>Joker2 is the same, but no where near as good.<br>The music was unnessecary, and the film would have benefited from a longer period of him being out fo jail, on a murderous rampage."
"Not only are movies dying, movie theatres are dying"
Great video great points
ALIENS ... ?
"Movies, video games, it‚Äôs all the same story. The people with all the power and money within these industries are the least talented people and are ruining successful franchises one by one."
"Art the Clown demolished Joker this weekend, and it had a $2.5M budget. Hollywood is going way of the dinosaur."
That sucks. I haven‚Äôt seen it. But the feedback is so disappointing. ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô was a powerhouse of creativity to me. Damnit
Liked joker 2 more than the 1st. Fleck got what he deserved.
Thanks for saving me the time and money‚Ä¶ defs not gonna watch it
"Both JOKER and JOKER 2 are two movies that should not exist. There is absolutely no reason that this movie both of them should‚Äôve been even thought of. The joker did not need a backstory. The fact that Phoenix played such a terrible character, which played into today‚Äôs feeble society, that is so hyped up on taking drugs to figure out life is absolutely pathetic. These are two movies that need to be wiped from existence‚Ä¶ they are absolute garbage. Just like Robert Pattinson‚Äôs Batman, absolute garbage."
Hollywood lives under the narcissistic delusion that they are more powerful than universal archetypes
As soon as I found out it was a musical I said no thanks I can wait for max
"It wasn&#39;t a bad movie but there was a scene where I really felt wasn&#39;t necessary and I did not like it. I felt it was too much for most audiences, regardless being R-rated by american standards. Part of the story line wasn&#39;t very clear."
"The writer was trying to prove exactly what he did: ppl were only interested in the Joker when he behaved like the Joker-not when he was just Arthur. The audience treated him just like Harley did. Whether we enjoyed the film or not, the director proved his point simply by how ppl have responded."
each to their own. i heard gay people liked this movie.
Not only it sucks but it‚Äôs disrespecting to Heath Ledger as well
Hollywood is killing itself. It makes no sense. It&#39;s like they are purposely trying to lose everything they have. The notion of &quot;I&#39;m too big to fail&quot; applies to NOTHING! Including Hollywood.
There was only one Joker and he can&#39;t make any more movies.

"The first movie was perfect. It presented the story of this &quot;Arthur Fleck&quot; who&#39;s actually just a figment of Joker&#39;s imagination. You know, one of his multiple choice pasts? All they needed to do with the second movie was pretty much the same, but with Harley in the mix."
"Back to the future 2 ,indiana jones 2 are examples of sequels that were not planned bit killed it at the box office"
Good. A dishonest review wouldn&#39;t have been much help after all.

I&#39;m really glad you spoiled it for me because I was going to waste time watching it. Now I&#39;m not. What an unbelievably stupid ending for a character that huge.
"as a wise Marsupial said in a different video. &quot;The movie is too obsessed on telling why the first movie was bad, and forgets to tell their own story.&quot;"
there is quit a few movies with good sequels that weren&#39;t planned when the first one was made
No one expected another clown from a different genre to beat Joker 2 at the box office.
Not gonna waste even a dollar on watching this gong show.
Hollyweird needs to stop releasing musicals expecting any kind of profit. We are not in the early 60&#39;s anymore

terminator 2 wasn&#39;t planned before the first movie was released. it was just capitalizing on popularity. they basically just did the same thing but reversed the roles. it did way better. so it is possible as long as you build on the first movie and make it better while still trying to please the fans. joker 2 tried to insult the fans
I just didn&#39;t want to sit with my buddies while watching a musical.
"Is Kamala Harris Joker; or the society that helped create Joker? Alternatively is Kamala The Joker.

ROCKY 2 and ALIENS come to mind.
Terminator 2
Aliens &amp; Terminator 2
Bitterly disappointed by this sequel üò¢
Walking Phoenix
"Evil Dead 2 is dramatically better that the first. And if you think about it, there are a number of horror movies series where the repeats are as good and successful. Outside of that, I agree."
"The movie was a genius piece of art. Picks right up where the first left off. It‚Äôs not a musical, yes there is some singing, but it is all delusional thoughts in his head. Amazing!! Ppl forget the amount of singing and music in the first film. A great ending to this story."
I&#39;m not recognizing this as having anything to do with The Joker.<br>The director should be sued.
Joker 2: A Folly...Duh.
Successful sequels <br>Ghost busters 2<br>Blade 2<br>Batman returns <br>I can&#39;t think of anymore tbh üòÇ

This has absolutely NOTHING interesting, Joaquin does NOTHING NEW, and presents nothing interesting, Gaga who is supposed to be a musician, sounds like somebody singing in their kitchen while cooking a meal, it&#39;s EMBARRASSING.<br>This says something about the lack of imagination, creativity, artistic quality etc, basically the HOLLOWNESS that is the Woke ideology that has taken over everything. They are stripping the world of all its interesting edginess, to replace it with BLAND."
Yes Aliens and T2 but I‚Äôd also put Die hard 2up there.

A musical????  That would be it&#39;s death.

"Aliens, Superman 2, Lethal Weapon 2, Terminator 2...."
The way the internet is talking about the joker 2 makes me think it‚Äôs actually doing the opposite
They made a great movie into a musical. That right there will discourage so many movie goers. No one wanted to see a musical they mearly  wanted to see the story continue
"Sequels that weren&#39;t planned but made because the popularity of the first one - the godfather 2, empire strikes back, terminator 2, aliens."
That movie was awful. A musical bag of crap. Waste of time and money.

Lady gaga is a fairly good actress if you watch her other movies
I had no idea joker 2 existed till 1 week before the release
He should of embraced being the joker broke out of prison with harley and rained terror on Gotham together like there supposed to and would of left room for a third film with batman and this version of the joker there so the first 2 movies would of shown how the joker was created
"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.  WAY better than the the first.<br>Also, Shrek 2 for that matter."
Only Americans can‚Äôt pronounce it
Star Wars was a standalone movie. Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi were both great and unplanned
Is it a woke shit show...
Aliens - unplanned excellent sequel?
"I can count on one hand the amount of sequels that have equalled or surpassed the original.  Doctor Sleep, Tron Legacy, 2010."
I&#39;m sure someone said that it dropped 85%.  Not sure how true that is.

The first one sucked too it was basically just about a meth head doing meth head stuff like I see that everyday on my way to work
Madagascar 3 is the exception.
"You would think that Hollywood execs know their business, but I can honestly say that, had I been asked whether making a musical version of The Joker was a good idea, I would honestly thought they were kidding. How could ANYBODY think that was a good idea?"

Now its destroyed and divisive by ruining what people liked."
Thanks Matt!
Makes one movie:
It was horrible
I like Matt Walsh but he just states the obvious. He never blows your mind w his views. Idk if that a testament to how crazy the world is or what
A couple of sequels that worked that I‚Äôm pretty sure were unplanned were Terminator 2 and Aliens.
"I loved the first this one is okay, but the pacing is so slow! The singing at times is terribly off key and it slows the packing down. I just admit that I don‚Äôt fully understand it. I have the feeling that he‚Äôs the brith or the joker and inspired someone else to become the ‚Äúreal‚Äù DC Joker. Perhaps even the psychopath at the end as you see him do something with a knife that may hint at something Leder‚Äôs joker had.<br>But it‚Äôs still a great social mirror. The first was about the problems in the US with mental health that didn‚Äôt get diagnosed or solved and created these mass murderers. This is more about society yearning for disruption and unrest and someone who stands up against what they see ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù.<br><br>But I don‚Äôt see the 190 million dollars budget."
330 in and matt is wrong! Aliens and Terminator 2
I thought the first movie sucked. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt even bother with the second. I could barely stay awake during the first
"Oo, scary foreign language!  Folly a doo!"
"A great exception, the second of the Mad Max movies."
"Joker 2 is embarrassing .. <br>These directors do as they please without any consequences for their actions. <br><br>Hey Hollywood, I ve got a couple of ideas: <br><br>- Joker vs Jason in the afterlife,<br>-  Saving private Joker or <br>-  Indiana Joker in the temple of doom."
"The problem was the director didn&#39;t like the movie he did was a scathing indictment of the very ideology he embraces.  He also lied  to the fans, and made it where the sequel ended doing what he claimed he wouldn&#39;t do: he linked his films both to Christopher Nolan&#39;s Trilogy AND to <b><i>The Batman</i></b> at the very same time he wrecked his own film!"
"Matt! Tell us what you think of The Rings of Power? As a Tolkien fan, I am so torn!"
"Empire strikes back wasn‚Äôt planned. Definitely an exception to the rule, but worth mentioning."
sounds like what they did in Matrix 4.
"Actually, Back to the Future was one of the few sequels that was not planned- but was sill highly respected. The makers of the original BTTF said the ending was simply a fun idea. If they knew they were going to make a sequel, they would not have let Marty&#39;s girlfriend Jennifer going the adventure."
I loved it. Don‚Äôt know what y‚Äôall are mad about
Terminator 2
"Maybe I&#39;m alone, but I watched exactly 1 hour of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine last night and it was garbage. More of Disney&#39;s obsession with the multiverse and split timelines, constantly jumping from one reality to another. It was miserable, nihilistic garbage in drab, depressing settings the whole time. I guess this was supposed to be offset by Deadpool&#39;s smart-ass quips, but they were so constant and endless that I just wanted him to STFU. <br><br>Everything about it tells me it was written by miserable post-modernists who want us to bask in the glory of tearing down and deconstructing our favorite franchises. Marvel must have fired all their original writers &amp; directors because its&#39; otherwise impossible to fathom how they&#39;ve fallen this far."
Honestly(I‚Äôm not included in this) but most of the General public‚Äôs is just waiting for it to hit streaming.
sequels suck !!!
It should be illegal to release movies this terrible
"Once the world heard it was a MUSICAL, everyone checked out. When will they realize we don&#39;t want damn musicals?!!! Cheers!"

"An important omission, that Americans continuously, almost purposely overlook, is that, Phillips, is a JEW. And his Bolshevism glowed throughout this movie."
Wasn&#39;t the Joker one of the characters on the old batman TV show.  Are they still making movies about this adolescrent stuff?  Who watches it?
"Personally, I was enthralled by the sequel, as was I enthralled by Megalopolis, which was also widely disapproved by the audience and critics."
"Matt, when you bring me out, can you introduce me as Woker?"
Why wasn&#39;t it called Joker face? Missed opportunity lol
"Joker 2 is a damn near masterpiece, all the bozo neck beards who idolize the joker for whatever reason are just mad they didn‚Äôt get to see their hero go on a killing spree or blow up hospitals (who shouldn‚Äôt be anyone‚Äôs hero or someone anyone thinks is a good guy). This is a grounded take on the joker and it feels like people forget that. In reality this is a mentally ill man who driven to murder by society and the system letting him down. We can sympathize with his plight but at the end of the day he is a murderer. If you don‚Äôt like that wah wah go watch the latest marvel movie. This isn‚Äôt your average cookie cutter super hero ip sequel, this is an artistic original piece of film. Unlike the first which is just a Scorsese rip off."

Rocky 5 and Rocky Balboa are my reason for being. I can‚Äôt identify with Matt‚Äôs assessment of unplanned sequels or prequels for that matter.üòä
"The Joker is supposed to be the depravity of society embodied and we got the embodiment of lame writing instead. They should recall the sequel, apologise to the fans, and make a better one."
I was so excited for the sequel. Then I saw the trailer a few months ago and never gave it another thought again.
&quot;Joker 2: The Joke&#39;s On US&quot;.
The original movie didn&#39;t make a billion dollars because of the ticket sales from incels
Terrifier 3 will be a more profitable clown movie. 2 mil budget
Avatar 2 did fairly well
Funny thing is even the people they were trying to appeal to think the movie is trash as well.
Aliens - was a great sequel that was unplanned but better than the original.
not a mis-step.  they ruined in on purpose just like they did star wars.
Spider-Man 2
Not sure if Home Alone 2 was planned.

It‚Äôs GARBAGE!
What did you expect when you put this monster of lady gaga in this kind of movie? Even before he came out no one wanted to see it because of her.
"I disagree that unplanned sequels are usually terrible. Shrek 2, Toy Story 2 &amp; 3, How To Train Your Dragon 2, Kung Fu Panda 2, Alien 2, Nightmare on Elm Street 3, and others. In general he is probably right, but so many exceptions."
"People are just blinded by their expectations of what this movie should&#39;ve been. This is honestly a great film, and a perfect continuation of the first."
"What is sad is that Hollywood and the comic book industry took characters originally designed for children and have perverted superheroes and villains and have confused good vs. evil. Superheroes are no longer individuals with high moral standards who always do what is right. Look at Marvel. They pushed it with PG-13 content, but, since they were making money, they kept pushing. Temporarily, they had a huge following. However, that generation gets older and moves on. Then, you end up with a product that cannot be shared with children - too dark, too mature, and not enjoyable."
"you make this video because it make you money? trendy trendy matt walsh. Jokes aside, this review didn&#39;t add anything new. This review is oddly ironic."
"As soon as they said &quot;it&#39;s a musical&quot; I went and took a huge dump and sat and watched that for two hours , and knew I would enjoy that more.<br>I can think of nothing worse than a musical ,only a musical about a decent character like the Joker..<br>Who thought that would be good as a musical, I think the Blues Brothers is the only film that is a musical that is worth watching.<br>Plus its bound to be as woke as anything.<br>The joker only offed white people , was a Muslim and identified as a woman."
"I strongly disagreed with you. For obvious reasons I dislike De Niro and Gaga, nevertheless, the movie respects the origin story and the fans.<br><br>SPOILER coming underneath<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>As long as the Joker is given an ID he is not the the Joker. Actually that made the first movie canonically problematic.<br><br>I didn&#39;t like Joker 2 as it doesn&#39;t march my taste. But it&#39;s"
Hollywood isn‚Äôt capable of telling a good story because of dei hires
Isn‚Äôt Tim Dillon in it though..
imagine there are movies in French.
"I was in Atlantic City for a weekend and the restaurant we were at was completely transformed into a, ‚ÄúJoker Folie a Deaux‚Äù theme. I was surprised at how they would seep into a random restaurant at a Casino hotel in AC. They must have dumped tons of money into marketing."
Amazing people would waste their time watching movies... Actors/entertainers are LOSERS...
Everything shitty has someone broke and woke behind it.
"Back to the Future was a great trilogy, and it wasn&#39;t planned as one until after the success of the first.  That&#39;s why they added &quot;To be continued...&quot; to the end upon its home video release.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the Matrix trilogy, which had two sequels that sucked major monkey nuts.  We won&#39;t even pretend that cinematic turd of a sequel came out a couple of years ago."
Terminator was a one and done. Terminator 2: Judgement Day was a cash-in sequel but was better. The other cash-in sequels weren&#39;t.

"outliers: <br><br>Superman II<br>Terminator II<br>Halloween II<br>Aliens (2)<br>National Treasure II<br>Top Gun II<br>Karate Kid II<br>Die Hard II<br>Hellraiser II<br><br>These are movies where the sequel (many were unexpected) did not suck and were in fact quite good. <br>Some like Terminator, Hellraiser and Aliens were actually better than the original."
Top gun Maverick wasn&#39;t planned and is maybe the best movie of the last decade
Tim dillon ripping on the movie (that he is in) on his last podcast was hilarious.
Bro. No offense but your thumbnail picture has got to go. It&#39;s such an unflattering picture. Take a new one. Thanks.
"Because this was done for a message, not entertainment."
Review the other clown movie! Terrifier 3! üòÖ
Terminator 2 judgement day
They&#39;re correct: People will mindlessly consume whatever is in front of them
"No creativity anymore , they have to rehash so many movies. The new crow movie was also crap"
"Matt: Hollywood, like the AAA gaming industry, like so many other industries, has been overtaken by excessive corporatization. The profit motive, while not wholly antithetical to high art, is POISON if it takes PRECEDENCE over &quot;great storytelling&quot; as you put it. Sooner or later, they are going to start looking past their spreadsheets and the B.S. promises of &quot;A.I. Art&quot; to discover the reasons why they keep failing. When they do, Attlas Conscious Arts will be waiting in the wings, an antidote to such &quot;consultants&quot; as Sweet Baby Inc., and others, to show them the difference between the obsolete binary Human 2.0 O/S and superior trinary Human 3.0 upgrade. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7djDy7kdPg0"">https://youtu.be/7djDy7kdPg0</a>"
"The Dark Knight<br>Terminator 2<br>Ted 2<br>Anchorman 2<br>The Empire Strikes back<br><br>‚Ä¶ each better than the first.<br>Other than those examples (I‚Äôve probably forgotten some), I agree entirely with the content of Matt‚Äôs clip"
This movie wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdoomed to suck.‚Äù I think literally all of us could‚Äôve conceptualized a superior sequel. This movie failed because there‚Äôs this stupid trend going around in Hollywood. We‚Äôre filmmakers feel the need to punish fans of a franchise if they are the ‚Äúwrong type of fan.‚Äù
Shrek 2
Shrek 2
Once I knew Gaga was in it it was a hard pass.
Lot of hate for sequels from the star of Borat 3
I stopped watching the garbage that has been coming out of Hollywood since last twenty years. I have a wonderful collection of DVDs and VHS movies. Anytime I want to go too the movie&#39;s. First I go to my movie library.
"Aliens, Empire Strikes Back. Wrath of Khan."
"He‚Äôs right it‚Äôs entertainment but gets claimed as all art but it‚Äôs more entertainment than <a href=""http://art.art/"">art.Art</a> is sometimes just bullshit.jackson pollock proved that."
Wtf matt.. shrek 2 was a sequel that truly exceed expectations
"what a shitty no point review, say anything thats an actual independent thought, just one, cant make one point, terrible"
"Bride of Frankenstein, 1935, (sequel) Often considered superior to Frankenstein, 1931. Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 1978 (remake) Often considered superior to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 1956. The Godfather Part 2, 1974, (sequel) Often considered superior to The Godfather 1972. Aliens part 2 , 1986 sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film Alien. It is the second film in the Alien franchise and is considered one of the greatest films of the 1980s."
"22 Jump Street has &quot;my name is Jeff&quot; and for that reason alone, I am glad it exists"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=175"">2:55</a> Aliens and Terminator 2 could be the exception."
Kind of proves the first was a fluke
Will your movie come to stream on any platform?
Jonkler
Terminator 2 was better than the original Terminator and I don&#39;t think it was planned. Even Star Wars was not supposed to be successful yet the sequel was arguably better than the first one.
I&#39;d say that Back to the Future 2 and 3 are the outliers.
"In the sequel, what happens to the people who are shit on and stepped over?"
The movie was made to troll Warner Brothers. 1 the director never wanted to make it. 2. He made it a musical to make it a flop. 3. He killed off Aurthur to insure another couldnt be made. 4. Its a PREQUAL. The prisoner who kills Arthur is the Heath Ledger Joker. <br>Read the the comic book The Three Jokers. DC has been playing with the idea that Joker is multiple people for a while now.
"The Godfather Part 2, The Empire Strikes Back, and Terminator 2 were not planned from the beginning. All of them contain some small story or world building ideas that preceded the first film, but they were not planned or conceived until after the successes of those first films."
Remember The killing joke? Would love the musical as whats going on his head intertwined with a very dark horror torture like part of him abusing gordons daughter.
Todd Phillips: ‚ÄúThe wrong people watched the first movie‚Ä¶well no one‚Äôs watching now.‚Äù
Aliens maybe ?
"Like habits they will make a trilogy from The Joker with nonsense story as it wasn&#39;t even told in the original comics . Even Nolan&#39;s trilogy of Batman has dated badly . Tim Burton&#39;s Batman 1&amp;2 were the best as the cartoon from late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s.  <br><br>Even the movie they made from Pennyworth was a failure no one remember it was made . What is next making movies from every Villains ? ( Penguin , Harvey Dent , Mr. Freeze , etc... ) who are the people moaning for that ? Can&#39;t people buy their fave comics anymore ? Can&#39;t people buy old movies&amp;shows on dvd&amp;bluray since they are cheap in all countries ? <br><br>We got already many nonsense super heroes movies that got made these last 15+ years . Many of them have their reboot already or being a reimagination from some wannabe movie producer/realisator that hasn&#39;t done great stuff . <br><br>Like i said in another video it is big time to let us enjoy older movies and shows from between 1950-1995 again for pretty long and that goes for every countries . Enough with the cr*p made in a split second Netflix/Disney+ shows it looks to me that all that was already ready in some drawer.  <br><br>Even shows needs their nonsense spin of&#39;s or making a come back as we see the actors being seriously old and not be interested anymore ( biggest example The X-Files last two seasons weren&#39;t needed at all the case was already done ) So many shows tried a come back they all failed drastically The Love Boat new generation,  Knight Rider , Dallas 2 , etc... <br><br>When will people understand that it doesn&#39;t work anymore . Star Wars has ruined itself into oblivion it didn&#39;t needed all the cr*p they made the original trilogy was enough to figure it all out . <br><br>Last it is time that people become &quot;mature&quot; &amp; &quot;adult&quot; and move on read new autors etc..."
"Dude‚Äôs never heard of Terminator 2, Aliens, Godfather 2, etc."
Honestly speaking movie had a little too much music (almost like a darker  high school musical version of joker)  but it was not a bad movie at all<br>Cut out the music and it is dark and grueling and superb! with peak Joaqin performance<br>100%! And badly forceful &amp; bossy Gaga direction.
Didn‚Äôt like the first one. Overrated. Why would I watch the second one?
"Alien 2, Terminator2, who did those and then failed with Avatar2?"
The flop Todd Philips deserved. This will permanently damage this tool‚Äôs career.
And about half of that $40M goes to the movie theater
i hope todd gets blacklisted
"I don&#39;t agree with your rule about sequels and the example I would give is Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan. This was intended by Paramount to be a much cheaper moneygrab after the successful but disappointing Star Trek: The Motion Picture, they brought in a new producer and a new director, neither of whom had ever seen an episode of Star Trek and they decided to kill off a much loved character.  In other words they did everything wrong you could do when making a sequel and yet Star Trek II is almost universally agreed to be the best Star Trek movie of all time."
You‚Äôre the best Matt
&quot;Hollywood for the most part no longer tells stories that they believe are worth telling&quot;.    Totally agree.
Back to the Future 2 was pretty strong. Back to the Future 3 Torpedoed it though so...
Joker 2: up your hoo shoo too.
your drama is good..the racist one..<br>-VG SOORYAJITH
Go see terrifier 3
It&#39;s a joke.
Joker 2 is piece of üí©üóëÔ∏è fuq WB and Todd Phillips btw
"I honesty would think a conservative american such as yourself might appreciate the film. He acknowledges his antics in the first film weren&#39;t justifiable, The woman he falls in love with instantly was just attracted to his persona and not him and when he takes accountability and tries to heal she loses interest, he is murdered by a man who takes on his identity who is actually truly deranged. The movie doesn&#39;t suck, it sucks as a Joker film in the comic book sense, but as a film about taking accountability - it&#39;s not bad and done well."
It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I expected it to be‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Which is weird because the acting was good. The design good. The music good(though id say they sang too much) and ran too long. Also lacked direction‚Ä¶ <br><br>Really just did a U turn on the message of the first movie
When are we going to acknowledge the obvious (Hollywood is subsidized)? It&#39;s the only reasonable explanation to a 20 yr run of politically infused slop where studios make large budget movies that they don&#39;t care lose money.
Top Gun Sequel is one of the best ever -  not planned ahead of time but you‚Äôre right there are no good sequels
"I wanna shove something in their face, but it‚Äôs not gonna be rotten tomatoes"
We all figured out it‚Äôs all a lie
Notice none of the mainstream media told people to not go see it? The media actually helped push the hype and marketing around it... interesting
"I never made it through the first one. I was told it was a right wing dog whistle but it was just a guy having a massive mental breakdown for a couple hours. Just pure pain. Not a great escape,  by entertainment standards."
the only case I can think of is the Dollars Trilogy
"‚ÄúRambo:  First Blood Part II‚Äù, quite possibly the only outlier."
"How is the doctor/phycologist... ( whatever) alive? Does her appearance as a witness negate the ending of the first flick? Why was Arturs&#39;s steps tainted in blood then? Not a romance, not a musical, not a court drama. Only an afterthought that has no point at all. Subverting the expectation of the audience has no weight, if the plot makes no sense. Dunno which one is worse, The Cringe of Power, or this thing... cause I am not going to call it &quot;Joker&quot;.<br>I&#39;d say that you should get every copy you can, to burn."
"If they spend more on marketing than they did on the movie, you can be sure it‚Äôs going to suck. A good movie doesn‚Äôt need to convince anyone to watch it."
"No one, and I mean NO ONE holds this against Joaquin Phoenix.<br><br>This was a crap story to begin with.  <br><br>Time for a new Joker‚Ä¶. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Dang. Saved me some money. Had no idea it was that bad!
"I seen this movie a few Saturdays ago, I didn‚Äôt like it overall‚Ä¶. A sing along for most of it.  The Joker and a sing along does fit and makes no sense what so ever!!! Making this in 2024 makes sense in a major sense for Hollywood, and not for the every day joker fans‚Ä¶. The fans being left behind for this‚Ä¶. I do agree with this take‚Ä¶. Makes me question to watch movies‚Ä¶. The music was too loud and left me disoriented and confused‚Ä¶. Took until the next day to fully recover‚Ä¶"
Deadpool gets better!
Shrek is an example of excellent sequels
Aliens and terminator 2 are both sequels that meet or exceed the first installment that I don&#39;t think were &quot;pre-planned&quot;
"Quick Question, are yp7 Reading a Script, or is This from the Matt Walsh Brain?<br><br>Also, Do you have Any Tips on h9w t9 Escapyme 44 years of Hell as a Disabled Neglected Super Hostile Blind Guy Ready to Set houses EVERY into Piles of Ash?"
I LOVE Matt Walsh! :)
Phillips sold out to the woke mob
There always a director who put his own point of view without his money and sending an entire franchise to shit.
"Back To The Future 2, not planned but still very good."
Casting lady Gaga..deserves to be a flop
I had no idea there was a Joker 2 in theaters.
Apparently a movie is good when u spend all of it slowly and quietly building up to the end where someone unexpectedly gets shot in the face. The original joker was just uncut gems Gotham style
The first one sucked
"Rocky 2, Terminator 2, Alien 2, Home Alone 2. Sequels that wernt planned from the beginning but still wound up great."
"Terminator 2, Aliens, Die hard 3."
Art the clown killed Joker whatever else it‚Äôs calledüòÇ
You can‚Äôt catch lightning in a bottle twice!
"The only sequels that were as good or better were movies with creators and/or actors who had enough control and juice to prevent a bad script. I can think of Aliens, Terminator 2, and Empire Strikes Back."
The first three Bourne movies were equally awesome. T2 surpassed T1.
A very Brady sequel!<br>üòä
Back in high IQ days we had film critique. Now all we are left is an &quot;honest review&quot;.
"The first joker was dog shit, why would the 2nd one be good? A movie about a guy who can&#39;t handle adversity in life and turns into a panzy, kills people and is applauded for it, absolutely disgusting."
its called words by the way. the pronunciation is in your dictionary lol your welcome
"The short scenes I‚Äôve seen‚Äîjust between the row of them‚Äîlooked good.  The acting,  So, haven‚Äôt seen much of the musical parts"
"This had absolutely nothing to do with hot gay sex!  I wasted, like, 8 minutes listening to Matt and... nothing!"
"I saw it, it sucked."
"Until people like sam Goldwyn are back in charge, nothing will change."
Wasn‚Äôt The Empire Strikes Back a sequel that technically wasn‚Äôt planned from the start?
"Couldnt care less. Had &quot;Zero&quot; interest as soon as I heard it was a musical. Since I will never see it, it has &quot;Zero&quot; negative effect on the 1st one for me."
Deadpool 2 .  As good as original and not pre planned
Musicals suck and liberals suck
"I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to see it the minute I found out that it was a Musical. I sincerely hate musicals, whenever a musical scene comes on. I literally just want to skip it to continue on with the plot.."
"I‚Äôm sure you just forgot about this one Matt so I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt, but Top Gun 2 IS one example of an unplanned sequel succeeding beyond all expectations."
U can&#39;t even COMPARE to the 1st movie. U know how many memes spawned from that movie? That&#39;s how you know its great:<br><br>1. Dancing on the steps seen<br>2. &quot;All I have are negative thoughts&quot;.<br>3. Laughing at Wayne meme.<br>4. Train scene meme<br>5. We live in a society <br>6. You get what you fking deserve<br>7. Bus scene with the note<br>8. Painting tongue meme.<br>9. Beating him up in the alley meme<br>10. You think ??? is funny? I do. And I&#39;m tired of pretending it&#39;s not.<br>11. Etc n more
This was as bad as that horrible Crow remake!!! Nobody wants to see two Junkies/Criminals in love in an awful movie that began at conception...ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Yeah, most moviegoers <b>are</b> unsophisticated. They think a movie being entertaining or moving to them, or merely featuring certain sorts of characters and/or themes automatically equates to a quality film. They viciously denounce movie critics for just doing their jobs, for happening to dislike or find faulty a film they enjoy. It is ridiculous and infantile, and I see it all the time."
Aliens and Terminator 2 are two unplanned sequels that equaled or surpassed the first movie in the franchise. You should look up the definition of &#39;literally&#39;.
It was pretty good.
Joker 2: Fillet of Shit
Die Hard sequels?
It is a flop and I love it. I knew once I heard it‚Äôs gonna be a musical. I thought to myself no one asked for this garbage.
"Terminator Judgment Day is an exception, I&#39;d say. It&#39;s a sequel that holds up even today!"
Doomed to suck! What a concept
The Dark Knight
‚ÄúSisu‚Äù cost ‚Ç¨6M. <br>Hollywood‚Äôs DONE. Way overdue.
Love the first one
"The first Joker was garbage as well. Not because of the content and themes therein, but because it is poorly written and takes too much from other, better films. I hate it with a passion. Needless to say, any sequel wouldn&#39;t be seen by me because there was no worthy bedrock to begin with."
"&quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules&quot; are rare examples of sequels that were so good, they surpassed the (already commendable) original film"
The first movie was one of the most overrated movies of all time. It was obvious that a sequel would be nothing but an empty cashgrab that completely contradicts the point of the first one.
"i was going to say shrek 2 because it was astronomically better than the already amazing original shrek, but it turns out that the franchise planned 5 movies before the first was complete. i stand by shrek 2 is the best SEQUEL of any movie series to ever exist"
"You can have exceptional sequels: Empire Strikes Back Back, Terminator 2, Dark Knight, etc"
The Bourne Ultimatum is the best Bourne movie and that&#39;s part 3!
Pheonix has been away from the movie business too long...people have forgotten about him
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=196"">3:16</a> spy kids 2"
"If you wat to be artsy, or send a message, dont do it in a beloved franchise like DC, Marvel. star Wars etc etc. Make your own indie movie that no one will watch instead."
22 Jump Street was better than 21 Jump Street. But largely because they leaned into what it was. I thought the 1st one wouldn‚Äôt work but they let it be what it was and that worked.
Rush hour 2
I wouldn&#39;t mind if Matt Walsh&#39;s movie reviews became a regular thing
"I saw Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born and she is terrible at acting, just awful.  She is an amazing singer but a terrible actress."
Blade Runner 2049 Did the first film proud.
"Honestly, this is why people are more excited about the other clown movie sequel, Terrifier 3."
The answer is Home Alone 2.
People walked out not even seeing half of it. A musical buwahahaha
Remember when Hollywood kept saying that in cells are the problem with this movie
"Very interesting how many commentators also point to James Cameron as the Master of Sequels, basically. LOL  I&#39;ve heard he can be hard to work with, but the guy knows how to make great movies. <br>(„ÉÑ) ‚òï‚òï(„ÉÑ)"
I thought the message of the film to take responsibility for your actions and not lash out at society was a good one. That&#39;s usually the stance of conservitism instead of blaming your problems on others.
I thought both films looked unappealing.  Never went.
"Joker, The Last Jedi"
"The movie may not have been planned but the plot for the godfather 2 film existed in its entirety im the same Mario puzo novel as the plot for the first film.  It was perfectly written as one story, and the movies are both dogshit by comparison anyway"
2 movies I can think of where the sequel was good but I don‚Äôt think it was planned originally. <br>Terminator 2<br>Sicario<br>The 2nd Sicario was way better than the 1st.
"I don&#39;t go to movie theaters anymore. Hollywood is dead to me since the dawn of the digital revolution. <br>No one does good work anymore, so why waste your money and time on stupid movies anymore???"
The Bride of Frankenstein wasn&#39;t planned and it was a better movie than the first one.
This movie sucks. They hated that we loved the Joker and forgot they were doing a movie about the god damn Joker.
They were trying to be creative and the same quality audience wouldn&#39;t appreciate it
I wonder if the creator of the duck song anticipated the successful sequel
Terminator 2
Top gun Maverick was a successful sequel that wasn&#39;t planned...
Joker 1 sucked too.
Terminator 2: Judgement Day
I never even knew they made a part 2 until i saw this video. I went and looked at the trailer and to be honest the fact that Lady Gaga is in it is enough for me to never watch it.
What about &quot;Aliens&quot;. It wasn&#39;t planned before the first movie came out and it is arguably better than &quot;Alien&quot;.
"so here&#39;s a sequel that was not planned when the first film was made, and was written by someone who was not even involved in the first film:<br><br>Aliens."
Robocop isn‚Äôt a bad movie. Not as good as the first one but ok. Mad max is a better film. Terminator 2 is a better film.
U actually watched this ? üòÇ
"I agree that if you don‚Äôt have sequels already planned after the first movie, they‚Äôre going to suck. Prime examples of planned sequels that did great; The Dark Knight, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Empire Strikes Back, Kill Bill vol 2, and Back To The Future part 3."
I think Aliens would be an example of a good sequel that was never planned during the making of the original.
"I don&#39;t think this is an intellectually good faith argument because it&#39;s very clear at the end of Joker 1, that the movie leaves on a cliff hanger. If someone doesn&#39;t plan on making more there is no cliffhanger. The movie exists in isolation and wraps up with a nice bow. It literally sets up the sequel in the last few minutes of the film. I only saw that first movie once so I don&#39;t remember the details exactly but I do remember very distinctly what was going to happen next because it&#39;s left wide open for  the narrative to expand. If Joker was to end there you don&#39;t show young Bruce Wayne (tons of implications there) and you don&#39;t show additionally conflict in his stay at Arkham Asylum. If you didn&#39;t have plans to make a sequel or don&#39;t want to lead your audience to believe there is the sequel than you don&#39;t write your narrative in a way that implies there will be a continuation. Showing young Bruce implies there will be a progression based on what we know of the character and he just commits a major crime at the end of the movie so yes that is is verified opening for more story. Maybe the director didn&#39;t plan another but his story beats provides the case for that reasoning which for the audience unless we are acting cynical also would come to the conclusion that there is more to come. In fact Todd Phillips had clearly expressed he wanted to make a universe in DC from the villains perspective in this art house type style so that again also implies this was the foundation for more stories like it."
The fact that they put so much money in ONE money is already stupid! When I saw the trailer I was already thinking ..:pass thanks. I‚Äôm not a big Gaga fan as an actress and also a sequel was absolutely not necessary! I feel bad for Joaquin Phoenix though.
"This is an awful take, but it is an opinion in this movie is merely subjective. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet, but I can‚Äôt imagine it could‚Äôve been this bad."
"This movie didn&#39;t give us what we wanted, but what it did accomplish was establishing The Joker as a true villain.<br><br>Even though Arthur Fleck killed people, he was way too sympathetic to be a true villain. He wasn&#39;t somebody you wanted to root against. In this movie, he was manipulated by Harley, who then turned her back on him, and then stabbed to death by the &quot;new&quot; Joker. I left not wanting justice brought to Arthur Fleck, but justice FOR Arthur Fleck.<br><br>This movie left me hating Harley and &quot;The Joker&quot;. Even if it wasn&#39;t the intended direction, I think the only way to salvage this would be to extend the series into a true superhero series, and have this new Joker ultimately vanquished by Batman."
we used to get good &quot;unintended&quot; sequels - early James Cameron comes to mind - he turned Ridley Scott&#39;s Alien into Aliens (which worked out great) &amp; his own movie The Terminator also wasn&#39;t designed for a sequel yet T2 is considered the best of the series. I do agree generally fwiw but you said you couldn&#39;t think of any examples so I figured I&#39;d chime in.
Todd Phillips is actually the Joker. He just wants anarchy for this movie for no reason.
"I saw this movie the day before the official opening and I didn&#39;t have this perception of it at all.  I viewed the ending as symbolic of Arthur realizing he had to say good bye to his original self forever if he wanted to continue in this world.  This idea coincides with the whole movie (to include the animation at the beginning), especially when Harley dumps him forever due to his lack of balls/continuation of Arthur.   I viewed the ending as a tragedy but not in the sense of Arthur being dead physically, but the fact that he really did want to exist as his original self, but had no choice but to kill that person to survive in the hell hole that is Gotham, and particularly Arkham.  <br><br>The other aspect I felt watching the movie was that just like Puddles and Murray didn&#39;t care for the way things went for them in the first film, the audience doesn&#39;t get to have exactly what they want or expect with the 2nd film.   Violence spawning violence type thing and it reminded me of the ending to Sopranos more than anything else. ¬†<br><br>It also seems to have become popular to double down on somebody else&#39;s opinion instead of actually watching the movie and focusing on it in its entirety.  Not unlike what we see in American politics today.  <br><br>Either way, I liked the movie and had zero issue spending two hours with my wife watching a FU--ING MOVIE.  LOL"
Top Gun: Maverick was excellent.
Folix a deu means a madness shared by two.
Won‚Äôt even watch this when it gets to tv as I thought the first was absolutely üí©anyway.
Alright Matt. I gotta correct you here. John Wick 2. Unplanned sequel released due to the success of the first movie and is better than the first movie.
"I haven‚Äôt seen it yet, I was planning to. Strange that we all know what happens to him. He should fight Batman very simple. People want to see how the character develops to be that guy who fought Batman and see things from a villain‚Äôs perspective."
Joker - &quot;And I thought my jokes were bad&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=181"">3:01</a> Halo 2"
I will never watch a Todd Phillips movie again!  Horrible waste of a great idea and he knew it when he made it!  Loved the first one too!
Mad Max 2 was better than the first I would say
Joker 2 is a meta analysis of how the fanbase of DC cant let a new take on a character exists. Thats why he did it. To show us how art is dying and thats whats killing cinema. Harley quinn is a representation of the fanbase
Aliens
"Did not care for it. Too abstract, no real value."
Hollywood spends 100 millions attacking the audiences and they lost money
"Wrong Matt, Predator 2 is mad. Same as T2"
"I could not possibly disagree more with Matt and all the other reviews. <br><br>The movie was superb, the musical portions were simply extensions of the madness and the whole point is that anyone could be the Joker.<br><br>I think most people just wanted the Joker to devolve back into the same old, boring ass superhero (adjacent) shtick that is unbearably overplayed.<br><br>He was not a hero, he was a utterly broken and abused psychopath that had an ending fitting for the life presented. <br><br>Perhaps the haters should just stick with the Avengers from now on."
Terminator 2 was great
"Terminator 2, inside out 2, incredibles 2, bad boys 2, paddington 2,  empire strikes back (not originally planned), Indiana jones and the last crusade (blasphemy to some), aliens, spider-man 2, etc"
The sequel to Joker should have been Batman üòÇüòÇ
Aliens - probably one of the few sequels that was just as good as the original in its own way.
Terminator 2 is a perfect example of a great sequel.
"Examples of exceptions:<br><br>Shrek 2<br>Toy Story 2<br>Fargo 2 (does that count?)<br>Ocean‚Äôs 12 I guess?<br><br>PoC was thought of later, was worthy sequel i guess up to part three that is<br><br>Trollz?"
The writers for Breaking Bad said Walter White was never going to have a good ending because he was a bad guy. Potentially the same case here. They couldn‚Äôt let Joker be a perceived anti-hero of the story.
"Todd Phillips, the Ari Shaffir of directors."
They wasted everyone‚Äôs time and money with this film.
"Just say it ...another Woke flop.  they do really hate their audience, especially young single straight white men.  What a waste of resources and amazing talent."
"Original would&#39;ve been a good one-off, but everyone wants to build a universe."
Matt&#39;s eyes seem a little slanted and slightly crossed.
The only movie that came as a sequel and better was deadpool 3 in my opinion
Mad max sequels and matrix sequels were only a handful of unplanned sequels that were great. Well maybe matrix was planned.
Terminator 2 is an example of an unplanned good sequel.
"Terminator 2 ,, aliens . Back to the future 2"
They turned him into a simp &amp; he got wiped out.
Bettlejuice Bettlejuice is the sequel exception.
Phillips will dethrone Ruin Round-head Johnston as the director for the biggest flop and MASSIVE LOSS financially for a movie studio. Phillips is done for anykind of work in Hollywood. He can join that clown DEziro in twirling add signs on the street
"AGREE, a film that wasn&#39;t planned to have sequel usually sucks Because the first film was never intended to have continuition. SOME STORY are meant to END. Movie Sequels that got pushed by STUDIO driven by $$ usually dpn&#39;t end well"
"Well I liked itüôã‚Äç‚ôÇ :(   I already knew Arthur was never going to be  the &quot;real Joker,&quot; but he got good character development and learned to take accountability and not pin it on a character everyone wants him to be."
Real american of you to say &quot;a title nobody could pronounce&quot;...The world is larger than the US.
"Comic movies and derivatives are overwhelmingly male focused. Us lowly normal people get that, how do prpfessionals not? Men dont see musicals, atleast not musicals like this."
"It was indeed ALWAYS doomed to suck, seeing what a masterpiece the first one is! I haven&#39;t even watched it a second time as to not spoil anything of the emotional memories I have of it."
Scream 2 was pretty good
"Exceptions to the rule: Terminator 2, Aliens. Great sequels that weren&#39;t originally planned"
Gotta stop hiring d.e.i checklist wackos for jobs they aren&#39;t qualified for. This applies from top to bottom but biggest offenders that immediately came to mind was Painfully unfunny Jordan Peel and his light skinned racist obsession and Leslie headland who was qualified to be hired as a director she was hired because she lied about a guy to appease wackos like kathleen kennedy who had a chip on their shoulder.
Seen the movie twice Phoenix  great accting enjoy great movie see it for yourself <br>.<br>.
Winter Soldier is the exception to that rule.
"You gives a shit about your film review, Matt? Why is this being recommended to me? YT get it together."
"The first Joker was okay, I probably won&#39;t see the second, and certainly not in the theater."
Not recognizing French terms that have been in English for a century makes you profoundly uneducated.
"If they had done the courtroom escape within the first 10-15 minutes and had him fully embrace the Joker persona while going on a chaotic rampage of Gotham City with Harley Quinn, and vaguely foreshadowed young Bruce Wayne&#39;s need to become the Caped Crusader, they would have had a solid sequel."
I feel nothing for people who lost money watching this stupid AF movie. Everyone should know better at this point.
Horrible movie. <br>It appeared to be an attempt at some form of ‚Äúart‚Äù.
"honestly, the first movie is very overrated the ending was dumb after the entire movie of build-up for nothing"
Joker 2: Fully a Deuce
üáßüá∑üëç
"Todd Phillips stood on the shoulders of Pheonix and Scorcese. The 2nd film fails bc Phillips was never as brilliant as Joker made him seem. Taxi Driver was genius, Joker 2 is no taxi driver."
"First Mistake was Lady Gaga, nobody wants to see a random super liberal musician try to transition to an acting career, she is unlikeable in every sense of the term. How was she going to take over the role from Margot Robbie of all people and expect to measure up to her in any way shape or form? That in itself is laughable. Second Mistake was running it as a Musical, this isnt the 70s or even the 80s and I don&#39;t think there is much of an audience left for Musicals in the modern world. The whole thing stinks pf pathetic cash grab attempt and most people were smart enough to see it coming a mile away. It&#39;s hot garbage. But then again the first one was pretty crap as well."
Aliens was not planned by Ridley Scott and became more successful than Alien
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=5"">0:05</a> it‚Äôs french bro. Come on."
repeating what happens in the first does not  sit well with me. not watching it. love the first. just won&#39;t waste my money and time on the second
A woke supported movie with Phoenix and Lady GAGGER .......and not enjoyed..... hmmmm the woke community is devouring itself from the inside..... patience folks it is all good
"I never understood why the FIRST movie was successful. I thought Phoenix and the movie missed the whole POINT of the &quot;Joker.&quot; Jack Nicholson, to my mind, captured the REAL &quot;Joker.&quot;"
Todd Phillips&#39; real last name is Bunzl BTW
Back to the future 2 wasn&#39;t planned until after the success of the first.
Didn&#39;t even have to watch it to know it sucks
"I thought the first joker movie was trash too, imo it was nowhere as good as people made it out to be."

"The only way to salvage Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s Joker and keep part 1 intact is if you look at it from this perspective. At the end of Joker (2019), it says &quot;The End,&quot; signifying that Arthur Fleck&#39;s story is complete. The joke he was thinking about before the movie ends is actually Joker: Folie √† Deux (2024) It‚Äôs so absurd that it makes him laugh, which is why the Arkham psychiatrist asks him, &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; He responds with, &quot;I was just thinking, something of a joke,&quot; and when she asks if he wants to tell her, he says, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t get it,&quot; before he starts singing. Basically, the events of Part 2 didn&#39;t actually happen‚Äîthey were all in Arthur&#39;s head. That way, we don&#39;t have to dismiss Part 2 completely, but we can still see it as something that didn‚Äôt actually take place."
"I would take this critique of ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù with a grain of salt.  Being a master of film after ‚Äúwhats is a woman‚Äù and ‚Äúam I racist‚Äù, its easy for a legend in the film industry to say a high budget ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù hollywood (i just threw up in my mouth)  film is sub-par, just because it sucks.  Matt Walsh has to look back at his days of podcasting in his car and empathize.  These people are unprofessional, unfocused and maybe just stupid."
"What is a supposed conservative doing watching R-rated, Hollywood g@rbage films for anyway??"
Pay me $75. and I will go see the new Joker movie.üòÅ

The only sequels that are better than the original off the top of my head.<br>The Godfather 2<br>The Empire Strikes Back<br>The Wrath of Khan <br>Austin Powers 2<br>The Road Warrior/Mad Max 2<br>Terrifier 2<br>X-Men 2<br>Logan <br>Harry Potter 3rd and 4th movies are better than the first 2. <br>I would put Alien and Aliens on the same level.
Joker the musical.<br><br>Yeah that is not going to do well.
I think it‚Äôs a smart move for Todd Phillips and Phoenix
Ghostbusters 2 was as good as the first and probably not at all planned before the first movie.
There are obvious examples for the unplanned sequel rule.   For example Aliens and Terminator 2.
lady gaga aint a good actress
They make everything nowadays so dark and twisted Hollywood gets off on it they try to corrupt the minds desensitize they use actors who have had massive trauma and they cause that trauma
"It was like a bad My Cousin Vinny. (I love that movie) No, seriously, the trailer looked awesome but‚Ä¶I was bored. üò¢ It made me sad because I like all the actors."
"Interestingly, evil does not have imagination. Exorcists will tell us that the demonic has no imagination.<br>And one thing is for sure, Hollywood has been demonic for a very long time. Pure unadulterated evil."
Joker 2 is very flawed but better than most big budget movies.
Terminator 2 was better than the first and it was not planned at the same time as the original
They TRIED way to hard.
First &amp; second were garbage imho
Terrifier 3 beat it take your kids to watch that it‚Äôs a fun family film lol
Hey Matt. Can you play that banjo and do the charelston?
Terminator 2 is better than number one
"Top Gun 2, the exception.  Not planned but it was decaders in the making."
"Fell asleep over 6 times. Its boring, it sucks in every way. It was theatrical garbage of the lowest tier."
"100% agree with everything you said here.  However, I could write a third movie that would keep everything in the first two movies and would have all the fans raving.  To the point where it would not only break a billion dollars, but would have everyone going out and rewatching the first two movies again to catch what they missed."
"As much as a love Phoenix&#39;s take on the Joker, I just can&#39;t see this Joker going up against Batman. Maybe what happened was after the first Joker movie proved to be so profitable, the studio realized if they were going to make more Joker movies, they would need to replace the Phoenix Joker with one that could pose a real threat to Batman."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=147"">2:27</a> Empire Strikes Back!!!"
It&#39;s a humiliation ritual for those who felt seen by the first one.
"Master Bruce, have I ever told you about my time in the SAS? Well, I was sent to South Africa to attend the UN in an attempt to pacify threats over the whole Rhodie independence debacle. Of course, we were all debriefed as to what was happening down there, and we all thought it was a terrible pity. It wasn&#39;t until I stepped off the boat and onto the savannah that I began to understand that perhaps the Rhodies had a point. He&#39;s come a long way, you know, the domestic subsaharan African; but there&#39;s something about seeing him in his own ancestral habitat that betrays his nature. The first native africans I met were a couple engaged in non-consensual coitus beneath a baobab tree; their screeches were so alarming that the whole camp had come out to make certain that a panther hadn&#39;t gotten into the horses. But no, it was this. Now, the Rhodies proceeded to do something in which I at first tried to intervene--hesitantly, I might add--but experience taught me it was fair to let them see it through. They snatched the offending fellow with lassos and dragged him off to this absolutely immense warehouse, or barn, as it were; a quite impressive structure, actually, and though I didn&#39;t follow them in, the noises that echoed out from it didn&#39;t leave much to the imagination. I remember saying, &quot;My God, it&#39;s been fifteen minutes, how long have they got left?&quot; and the Rhodie next to me said simply, &quot;Well gov, after they&#39;re done, it&#39;s my turn.&quot; I soon realized that the gentlemen who were gathered with me outside the warehouse door hadn&#39;t assembled for a bloody tribunal, they were all in line for a shag. Yes, some of those chaps were even UN. I suppose most men can&#39;t just go on holiday and keep their trousers up the whole bit. Regardless, the next morning, everyone acted as if nothing happened. I chanced upon the melanated fellow whose intercourse I had interrupted the night before, now crawling along the ground toward the sunset, leaving a wavering trail of excrement behind him. He was shaking from head to bloody bum. Suffice to say his criminal impulses had been indefinitely subdued. Anyway, the point that I&#39;m trying to make, Master Bruce, is that you need to sodomize this Joker character--in the arse--&quot;buck breaking&quot;, I think you Yanks call it. We&#39;re simply out of options."
"We don‚Äôt need Matt Walsh‚Äôs take on everything. Jesus. Title this video ‚ÄúMatt Walsh says same thing everyone else does, but in his typical ‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused and rambling guy‚Äù voice.‚Äù  üôÑ"
The first one was junk so I can‚Äôt imagine the second would be any better
"Batman and Batman returns are definitely an example. while returns isn&#39;t exactly better than the first film, it&#39;s equal to its predecessor. anyone agree?"
"Exception: Aliens. I doubt I&#39;m the first to say it. 100% I agree with the sentiment, just naming one exception."
Why should I make a movie for people I don&#39;t like? You&#39;d think &#39;I want to take their money&#39; would be a good motivation. But art transcends capitalism for hollywood.
"&quot;The industry in it&#39;s current form, won&#39;t last forever, or probably for very long...it doesn&#39;t deserve to.&quot;<br><br>Couldn&#39;t have said it better Matt, and thank god it won&#39;t!!!  Time to get back to real movie making."
I find origin stories of super heroes (and villains) always to be more interesting than the action packed sequels in the first place. Mostly because I prefer character studies to be more interesting than action movies in general.
The current box office hit &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot; is a great sequel which was not planned.
"Terminator 2 was as good, if not better, without a thought of a sequel"
It takes every bad turn in writing it had an opportunity to do.  Than at the end the dumpster fire drives directly off a cliff.
Maybe it&#39;ll be a &quot;Cult Success&quot; movie...Like Shawshank Redemption...it didn&#39;t do well initially either.
The first one was a masterpiece.
I can think of ONLY TWO sequels that exceeded the original:<br><br>Bride Of Frankenstein <br>Terminator 2
"Funny...I never saw any ads...???  Oh, that&#39;s because I don&#39;t watch &quot;T.V.&quot;"
Some old TV shows maintained excellent writing for hundreds of episodes.  Each episode was self contained and consistent with episodes that came before.  Some series writing got better as the seasons progressed.  This is a lost skill in today&#39;s Hollywood.
"If the musical bits had just been the one where they danced in the rain, it would have been a fine movie. It was because it turned into a Lady Gaga concert that made it hard to stay in the theater for the whole movie.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s not Gaga&#39;s fault. She&#39;s a fine actress. She just did what they told her to do."
The fact that Matt Walsh spent a penny on a Hollywood movie is disappointing.
Saw it. Only few parts are ok. Too musical for me.
Aliens and Terminator II didn&#39;t do that.
"In terms of good, not &quot;pre-planned as a part of trilogy, etc.&quot; sequels, you have Terminator 2 and Aliens."
"THE ENDING EXPLAINED (Just got it now!)<br>I seen the movie, thought it was one of the worse films I‚Äôve ever seen, just slightly above slipstream. I thought the ending was weird and dumb too‚Ä¶. Until I heard Matt point out that the guy who stabbed Arthur Flek is probably going to become the Joker‚Ä¶ now I get it! Still sucked, but the ending is kinda cool, now that I get it. The other guy who stabbed him wasn‚Äôt really there. That‚Äôs Arthur‚Äôs alter ego, ‚ÄúThe Joker‚Äù, who will now take over! In the beginning of the movie, there was a cartoon where the joker‚Äôs shadow locked the joker in a closet, while the shadow went out on stage. I get it now."
Stars queen of the wokes.. Lady Gaga. So I‚Äôll give it a miss
"Obviously...it&#39;s. A financial flop. And .It opened w $37.5 mil(less than weekend estimates,by A LOT!)"

You need to drink some raw milk and stop watching this crap
"Movie industry is not dying, it&#39;s dead and gone.  We need a completely new Hollywood free of diddys and diddlers.   Maybe Elon will build one..."
"This movie was deep and brilliant. If people walked out, then the content went over peoples head and the message of the movie was spot on."
"Unplanned sequel that, for many, not all, but many, is a better film = Aliens<br>It&#39;s for sure debateable, but even that is saying something."
"Aliens wasn‚Äôt planned and it was just as good or better than the original Alien. It‚Äôs possible, but very very rare."
"Exceptions to the sequel rule: Aliens, Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, Blade Runner 2049"
"I can&#39;t even think of a worse movie. Plan 9 from Outer Space? The singing is OFF-key.

On the 85th Anniversary of Batman, the public deserves better. DC goes from the awesome tandem of Christopher Nolan and Snyderverse, where superheroes kick ass, to the glorification of evildoers and lawlessness. WTFU."
Exception: Top Gun Maverick üõ´
Hollywood remakes movies to keep you in a controlled bubble. No outside thinking allowed.
One outlier sequel that was as good/better than the original which comes to mind is Cameron‚Äôs ‚ÄòAliens‚Äô
"I don‚Äôt know if Terminator 2 was part of the creator‚Äôs original intention, I think it wasn‚Äôt, and most folks agree it‚Äôs far better than the original."
You should stick to the politics please
Matt Walsh called Avatar 2 a flop I really don‚Äôt know if he knows what flop means
I would rather watch &quot;Jokernado&quot; <br>Tornado of Jokers is terrorizing Hollywood.
I know my opinion is going to be unpopular but I actually really like the movie
"Matt: &quot;Everybody knew the movie was coming out...&quot; <br>Me, someone who didn&#39;t even know they made a sequel until right now:<br><br>Edit: There are a few sequels that weren&#39;t planned and were better than the original, like Terminator 2 and Evil Dead 2, and Back to the Future 2, but I guess that&#39;s subjective and even if you agree Matt&#39;s point still stands, even if there are none, its&#39; very rare."
I legitimately had no idea this movie came out. No marketing got to me at all.
I knew it was gonna be horrible as soon as I heard lady gaga was in it
They could‚Äôve made this a really interesting in-depth look of a manipulator and his psychiatrist and how people who are in a dark place see that is love. And that would‚Äôve further the story of Arthur Fleck the Joker and said we get a courtroom drama musical.
"The movie is not bad, the problem is that this is not the Joker movie"
The director Todd stated he didn&#39;t want to make this movie. The studio made him. So it&#39;s looking like he intentionally killed the project. Which is why he killed Joker at the end of the movie.
Director refused to do public screenings.  The premier was the 1st time anyone saw it.   Big risk and failed
"the first one was crap, too."
Joker 2: Fellate a Dude
"I agree with your analysis Matt and always enjoy your insight.  I think (but not certain) that Unbreakable was originally intended to be a standalone film, but Split was an exceptional (IMHO) movie sequel that continued the series but had an entirely new story and approach.  The viewers didn&#39;t even realize it was a sequel until the very last scene, which I thought was brilliant!  Other than that, however, I can&#39;t think of another movie sequel that wasn&#39;t part of an already planned larger story that really worked well, not that I don&#39;t sometimes enjoy those sequels but they&#39;re usually just a bigger version of the original story."

Feminists bodysurfing on Normandy Beach in 1944.
Joker 1 was so good Hollywood had to destroy it because it&#39;s message was that the elite don&#39;t care about you and that hit home too well
"Honest question: wasn&#39;t there&#39;s zero godfather 2 source material and wasnt it originally planned to star Robert Duvall again ?that might be an outlier for your theory, although I&#39;m not sure because I think some of godfather 2 has some of the original books plots...? Either way, you&#39;re definitely on to something"
Kinda the same thing happening to the Comic book industry
In the Biden Harris regime economy nobody has extra money to go to the movies! We are struggling to survive!
"Terminator 2, Lethal Weapon 2, there are more, it isnt that sequels inherently suck, its hollywood is devoid of actual talent or audience connection at this point."
"I was very bored during the entire thing. It felt like a musical with how much singing was involved, but not any good singing and the same songs being sung over and over. Harley Quinn is supposed to be there for joker and she just ends up betraying him, which was never how the original story went. All around bad movie n"
So pretentious she didn‚Äôt bring anything to the movie. I don‚Äôt think she can really act she does something but I don‚Äôt think you can call it acting maybe high-end performing?
"Some of it depends on taste, but either way, sequels apparently planned later that were at least nearly as good: terminator 2, aliens, (2nd alien) dark knight, Batman returns, (depends on taste) mad max 2 road warrior, spider man 2, maybe Toy Story 2, definitely Star Trek 2, mission impossible 3, x-men 2, some say Superman 2.<br> Oedipus Rex was a prequel.<br>Some say avatar 2 was as good as 1; really not sure. Likely planned anyway; regardless, avatar wasn‚Äôt really that good, and most of the cultural impact was technologically derived and went with the first movie. <br>James Bond, as really goldfinger (3rd) and from Russia with love some say, were better than Dr No. But books, so pre-planned. Harry Potter pre-planned, maybe, and opinions differ. (Did she actually plan out the specifics of plot of book 2 and 3 before 1? And really, everyone likes either 2 or 3 better than 1, though usually not both.)  I would say hunger games got better. Maybe twilight 3 and 4 better? No idea whether those were pre-planned."

"I just got a crazy idea. What if a group of like say the 10 largest movie review youtubers started advertising that we should stop going to theatres until they get the chance to watch a movie. If it‚Äôs good, then we can go and give it a good opening weekend. If it‚Äôs bad, we all agree not to watch it. Hollywood would tank hard for bad movies."
Tremors 2. Duhhh
Terminator 2 and Aliens are two great examples of sequels that are at least as good or even better as the first one and both movies were not planned when the first ones came out. Top Gun Maverick is also another great example.
I liked it
Alien 2 is an example
"My question is, with all thats going on in the world, who cares about a movie about some idiotic psychopath anyway?  Movies should lift up the human spirit.  The whole thing is a reflection on the current state of mind of people in general - in the toilet."

I consider myself a big movie buff with a ranged taste in movies. I watched the first(Thank god streaming) and couldn&#39;t understand the acclaim. I will not be paying to watch this sequel either....
The only real person less sympathetic than the fictional Arthur Fleck is Joaquin Phoenix.
That‚Äôs fkn terrible. The idea that somebody who WANTS to be joker would kill the thing he idolizes is just a low IQ plot. They did that to make a 3rd movie.. and a 4th‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ smh
Joker 2 is a work of genius.
Great critique! Joker 2 is a new Matrix Resurrections...
The whole thing is a Follie of Ducks.
honest review what joke. iv never seen your channel before but i wont be watching it again. get off the band wagon and have your own opinion mate..... then you can put honest in your titles.
"Rambo2, rocky2, hills have eyes 2, devils rejects, bad boys2, 2 fast 2 furious, the lost world jurassic park, free willy 2, jaws 2, the second ninja turtles movie (the older ones), the second mortal kombat movie, all solid sequels imo."
What are some other examples of movies that had a better or equal sequel?   Curious what people think.
"That‚Äôs a shame.. joker 1 was one of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen. If your IQ is 100 or less, I‚Äôm sure you were bored. If you‚Äôve never suffered a day in your life, I‚Äôm sure you were bored. If you don‚Äôt understand music composition, I‚Äôm sure you missed the greatness of the soundtrack.

The first Joker sucked as well so no surprise that the sequel sucks!
Gremlins 2
This Movie could have been one of the best Psycho/Thriller out here. And they just  decide giving Joker a stupid klischee change of heart like in every second movie and belive the Audience is gonna like it‚Ä¶
Saw it. Didn&#39;t plan on going to a musical. Boring...
"The 1st movie also sucked. It was plagiarized from other old movies. Lame, boring and the guy was a cry baby for the fist half. I wanted to see joker burn the city down for 2 hours. Not be his therapist. I don&#39;t need to know his reasons."
"The walmart Madonna,  ga ga , is a terrible actress. Ra ra ga ga ga ."
Hated the first one. Not watching this one
"The ending actually sounds interesting to me. A whole new Joker who thought the original was a hack. I&#39;m 65 and haven&#39;t been to a movie theater in over 5 years. Hollywood can kiss my pink, shapely, somewhat hairy ass...."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> Top Gun Maverick"
I think the movie sucks and I haven&#39;t even seen it!
"Nice job a few weeks after the fact <br>How is your film doing, by the way!"
"Terminator 2 was a much better movie than The Terminator and I don&#39;t think the sequel was pre-planned when they made the original. But otherwise, I think he&#39;s right."
Joker 3 : Mange La  Merde
I&#39;m a fan of first and didn&#39;t think it was bad.  Certainly could have been better.  No question Joaquin is the greatest living American actor by a mile.
Terminator 2 is an exemption
I&#39;d rather watch the Bachelorette on loop than see Joker: Dropping a Deuce movie.
I won&#39;t waste my time on it. But I will give a preemptive Booo!!
"Making a movie to smite fans just doesn&#39;t make any sense, there&#39;s gotta be more to it. I can&#39;t even find where in the movie they spent $200 mil. Unless there were gigantic explosions and mind blowing sfx, which i didn&#39;t see. For that much they could&#39;ve hired Wilem Dafoe, Jared Leto, and Joaquin to play 3 Jokers each trying to prove who the real Joker was. What a waste."
"I&#39;ll take it a step further.<br><br>the people who create this are SO out of touch, that they may even perceive the buzz on the internet and backlash as &#39;success&#39;. <br><br>I always say that you can show people better than you can tell them. I think the appropriate response would be to not acknowledge it. Stop making YouTube videos and critiques and commentaries about it. it will not empower them to keep making more. because a combination of NO reaction AND no profits will deliver the message well enough. It&#39;s like when you&#39;re in a relationship with a psychotic woman whose mere existence is predicated on attention. When you starve them of it, they begin to behave themselves. But we all know that the best course of action is to not deal with her at all."
Most guys aren&#39;t really into musicals. You couldn&#39;t pay me to sit through LaLa Land.
Lady Ga Ga. Enough said.
"The eternal problem of today&#39;s entertainment: Self-centered people create a product, announce to the four winds that it is not for traditional consumers and when it fails, they blame that excluded audience for not consuming their product. If that reasoning doesn&#39;t seem stupid to you, it&#39;s because you are."
"It‚Äôs a woke musical , of course it sucks"
Grown ass men need to grow up and stop with the plastic underpant wearing superheroes.<br><br>Enough already.<br>Comic books and toy guns and video games are fun ...now its time to hand them over to the actual kids and go clean your room.
The first one was terrible and way overrated. Can‚Äôt believe it even got a sequel
"If you&#39;re drawn to psychological explorations of how society glamorizes criminals, and can set aside expectations of a typical comic book &quot;Joker Boom Boom Bang Bang&quot; spectacle, this film might resonate with you on a deeper level. It challenges viewers to reconsider their relationship with fame and infamy, offering a darker reflection of our culture&#39;s fascination with villainy. Though the musical elements felt a bit excessive, I found that once I shifted my perspective, seeing it less as a typical superhero narrative and more as a commentary on the human condition, the film became more intriguing."
Dune Part 2 is the greatest sequel ever
SHREK 2 IS THE EXCEPTION
Sounds terrible
Lady Gaga? The poor mans. Madonna! Plus! Madonna sucks üòÇ
"Unplanned sequels?  How about the James Bond franchise?   Instead of long story (like Lord of the Rings), they have a tried and true formula."
Thanks for saving me some money on a movie ticket üòÖ
I thought they would have pulled a Disney and did a DEI gender swap on the Joker.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"No matter how mentally ill you are , there are consequences to your actions."
The Road Warrior was a good sequel to Mad Max. Exceptoon to the rule. Then Thunderdome was a terrible sequel. The rule.
I‚Äôd be doing you a favor üòÖ
Everyone knew 2 years ago. When they said it was going to be a musical. That it was going to flop.
"The daily wire doing movie reviews, whether you agree with whether the movie is good or bad, is a flop. None of them are cut out for it"
"I don&#39;t believe that T2 wasn&#39;t planned or a planned continuation of the story, yet very good and many feel it is even better than T1"
"The original Bride of Frankenstein was unplanned, but surpassed the original film."
TRAAAAAASH
Godfather 2 is a great example of a sequel done right
"There&#39;s much talk about them making Joker 2 in such a way as to alienate the fans of the first, whom they did not approve of. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not, but when articles exist with the title &quot;Joker: Folie a Deux has a message for fans. Go f-ck yourselves&quot;, you can see how that view becomes noticed.<br><br>When Variety puts out &quot;Joker: Folie a Deux&#39;s fatal flaw is turning the fans into the villains of the sequel,&quot; it gets more traction.<br><br>This message was also supported by independent reviewers online, and it quickly became the dominant message, with some asking even if they made it bad on purpose as a middle-finger to the fans.<br><br>Maybe there&#39;s a grain of truth in there somewhere, maybe none at all, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps they just fell foul of making a movie that didn&#39;t satisfy fan expectation either in quality or in the direction the story went. Fans seemed to be expecting a sequel set in the chaos at the end of the first movie, with Harley adding to the mix and the two crazy lovebirds being an insane criminal duo. They expected the Arthur at the end of that movie, a man who had finally &#39;mentally&#39; broken free of society&#39;s expectations and embraced his insanity. <br><br>Instead, they made a slow semi-musical bogged down in court-room proceedings, insanity pleas and asylum boredom, with Arthur in many ways reset to battling with himself again and denying the part of himself that he&#39;d accepted in the first movie. It just ... goes nowhere. <br><br>They went from a movie made on a meager $55 million which raked in over a billion, to a movie that splurged $200 million, and hasn&#39;t even made that back. Something clearly went wrong, and I guess in the words of the first Joker ..<br><br>&quot;You get what you f--king deserve.&quot;"
"It‚Äôs because the Jokers love story is one that wrestles with the realities of ‚ÄúLove‚Äù and our culture is afraid of real love, afraid of Love, afraid of commitment, afraid of reality."
"I loved the first Joker movie but recently I was talking with a friend about movies and he asked, &quot;What was the name of the new Joker movie again?... was it like... (and then me and my friend said it at the same time what Matt said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=475"">7:55</a>)... &#39;Joker... Foley... Whatever&#39; &quot; and we both burst out laughing at the same time, that&#39;s how I will remember this movie. The movie is a joke in itself ü§£"
Making it a musical was a massive mistake
"Actually, there was a ton of potential if they had gone with the original version of Harleen Quinzel, which is a much more tragic figure. But by now Hollywood turned her in to a girlboss character and wouldn&#39;t dream of making her an abuse victim."
"Not even ONE Joker fan likes musicals.  Not to mention, the previews made it look like a normal movie, not a boring musical.  This wan an intentional bait and switch."
Put a chick in it and make it gay!
"Terminator 2, Aliens just to name two obvious outliers that sprang to mind in about two seconds."
The title was more than enough evidence for me to know without a doubt that the producers and director are in love with the smell of their own flatulence.
Folly of poo
"The fundamental reasoning behind the plot is that the Flek dude was never really the Joker. He created the persona, but he didn&#39;t have the chops to back it up. So the idea was that the &quot;Joker&quot; was sort of an identity rather than a specific person. And I think this is an interesting take. For one, it allows for the variety of Jokers we&#39;ve had over the years. For another, it maintains the mystery of the character because we no longer know the origin of the individual, just the persona he adopted. Unfortunately, the film doesn&#39;t seem to have conveyed this idea very well.<br><br>Where the film failed is absolutely in its treatment of Flek. Whether or not it was an attack on the Fans is up for debate. But it was awful storytelling in either case. Flek didn&#39;t get where he was by process of reason and deliberation. He was driven there by a life of trauma. You don&#39;t just &quot;renounce&quot; psychological damage. Ask me how I know. And to then have him simply be beaten and killed after seeing the error of his ways was just an affirmation of everything he had believed, a justification for his actions. The story negated its own narrative."
They managed to make the 2nd best joker movie ever and follow up with the worst joker movie of all time
Bourne and Terminator had great sequelae
Tried to market a musical to a comic book fan.  That&#39;s why I think it Failed
Terrifier 3 will do better than Joker 2 electric boogaloo!
I hated the story. I thought Joker and Harley Quinn were going to show their love story and cause chaos.
"There are tons of sequels that weren&#39;t planned from the start and that exceeded the original...<br><br>Terminator 2, aliens, back to the future 2, ..."
Go woke go broke
"Wrong unplanned sequels do succeed rarely. Exemple Terminator 2. Also Matrix, Ghostbusters, American Ninja, Ninja Turtles sequels were pretty good."
A lot of these films are made for money laundering.
"Watch Transformers One instead, I saw it and guarantee... it&#39;s an extremely good movie."
"Neither Alien nor Terminator were planned franchises. Both did fairly well with their sequels. Star Wars wasn&#39;t planned, but Lucas did have additional material ready, so it doesn&#39;t really count."
The movie was whatever
Sounds like it should have been called the Woker‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The ending was so bad but it‚Äôs realeastic
Omg not you two Matt hahahahha
The first one was bad too
"The exception to the unplanned sequel rule: Terminator 2 Judgement Day. The first Terminator movie was fantastic, but by many accounts T2 was even better."
I thought the first one sucked.
valid
Just an example of a successful unplanned sequel: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.
Alien was never intended to have a sequel but it turned out great. The huge difference is though that the second part did enhance and not completely destroy the achievements of the first.
"I am glad Todd Phillips did this. Because this will be a litmus test whether Hollywood wants any of our money anymore. period. Will there be any kind of responsibility for this obvious middle finger to the entire fan base of the first movie or ...was it worth a half a billion dollars to Hollywood, to give us all that middle finger. To which I would say, I&#39;m not offended. I just don&#39;t care anymore. Time to turn off anything electronic and go outside into the sunlight."
Terminator 2 and Aliens were both excellent sequels.
"Shouldn&#39;t the studio sue the director for deliberately sabotaging a multi-million-dollar project? I mean, it&#39;s basically corporate sabotage right? Isn&#39;t there a law about intentionally and maliciously destroying corporate assets?"
Mad Max 2<br>You&#39;re welcome Matt
"Apparently Phoenix and Phillips didn‚Äôt want to make a sequel. I guess they couldn‚Äôt resist the 20 million dollar pay day (each!) but decided to subvert the movie in every way possible, almost as a ‚Äòthe jokes on you‚Äô to not just the audience but the studio as well‚Ä¶‚Ä¶talk about laughing all the way to the bank!"
"I‚Äôll watch it eventually. When I saw singing in the preview it gave me the ‚Äúno‚Äù feeling. I‚Äôm ok with music, but not when it‚Äôs shoehorned in where it shouldn‚Äôt be or in a way that doesn‚Äôt work."
I didn&#39;t even know they were making another Joker.
I have had ZERO interest in this flick. The fact they cast gagger showed me it would be stupid. They could have cast literally any woman in the world and they picked her‚Ä¶
This made as much sense as Taxi Driver 2: The Reckoning<br>Why can‚Äôt entertainment just be‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶entertaining???<br>Everything has to be so up its own @$$ pretentious and pandering for these days by celestial sized Egos
Terminator 2 is probably the only good sequel
"What kind of simpleton watches the 1st Joker film &amp; comes out of the theatre thinking &quot;Woohoo! Finally, a supervillain I can relate to. You go, Fleck! White male power!&quot; Then is disappointed that meek, bullied, abused loner Arthur Fleck still is who he is, a pathetic shell of a broken man, and will suffer the fate that such men suffer?<br><br>A child who watched the film in the first place because he was raised on comic books, maybe."
Has he not seen Aliens or Terminator 2?
"If they want a movie character to take responsibility for his own actios, why don&#39;t we hold people accountable for their own actions. In society today we give people a free pass for their actions, because of things that have happened in their lives. You can&#39;t give up and blame society for everything that happens to you."
"Look, it was not that bad, it was not the madame Webb level or  joker 1 and it told a story of mentally ill person who wants to be heard. If you open Instagram, Facebook or mostly TikTok it&#39;s full of them. All over the place. I think I could be the minority or even wrong this is where Phillips wants to take his story. A constant allegory,even the musical parts. I think in the future it will be more appreciated."
"The movie sucks because of the writers, director and money men.."
I watched ‚ÄúThe Ten Commandments‚Äù last night.  üòä
"Lady Gaga is not for this role, sorry. I liked the movie with the actress from wolf of wall street."
"Joker was already an overrated movie. It was good, well acted, compelling, well paced and overall very solid. <br>It was not a movie that will ever stand out as great or extremely memorable though. It‚Äôs not a movie you are going to want to rewatch years down the road.<br>It was also a solid self contained movie, it didn‚Äôt need or warrant a sequel.<br><br>While I can‚Äôt stand their personal politics and beliefs, I won‚Äôt deny Phoenix‚Äôs amazing acting (rewatch Gladiator, puts you on edge) and Gaga isn‚Äôt outstanding but she can still pull off some solid performances.<br><br>It was just a cash grab and a forced turd."
"I haven&#39;t seen the second movie, but Joker did not need a sequel."
"I thought Joaquin Phoenix acting was excellent, he can sing, dance and showed a real physical disability. I would not rate a 15 maybe an 18 I just don&#39;t know why they had to destroy the original DC comic story. 7/10"
"I watched it, I can see what they were aiming for.  They missed."
So it‚Äôs over?  Sweet.<br><br>   Pray up.
"hahah - i honestly don&#39;t think the front runners give a shite...  reduction, revamping, money balancing.. Everything has seemingly devolved into a  filter for a political ladder... TBH i enjoyed the joker movie - i heard they were making a sequel and i heard it was gonna be a musical.. !!! hahahahhah.  I aint touching that shit... unless a mate says &quot;you gotta&#39; watch this&#39; for heavy lols. This pandering, performative stain on an otherwise reviled character"
Lady gaga in it no thanks I&#39;m good
"It‚Äôs my favourite comic book movie of all time and I‚Äôm being completely genuine, it‚Äôs a sequel shitting on sequels as a whole. idk how people aren‚Äôt seeing that, there‚Äôs literally a joker movie in the joker movie and the girl from the first movie says it‚Äôs shit in court and Joaquin turns to lady gaga and she‚Äôs like nahhh.<br>Then you also see the joker fans chasing after him saying joker we still love you and when he meets lady gaga on the stairs at the end she says she only loves joker and not Arthur Fleck, it‚Äôs obviously mocking audiences for only liking hashed out characters over and over again on screen and not wanting anything original. This movie is a giant middle finger to everyone and it‚Äôs awesome<br><br>Folie a deux translates to madness of two which you‚Äôre supposed to think it‚Äôs about the madness of Harley Quinn and joker but it‚Äôs just madness of making two movies all the fucking time. <br>A sequel to end all sequels"
Would you give a dishonest review?
Actually it wasn‚Äôt that bad
"&quot;Heres my honest review... And an attempted ad load in the beginning of the video, an interrupting ad somewhere in the first five minutes followed by me stopping the segment to read an ad, and finally an ad the millisecond my content ends.&quot; <br><br>would have been a more appropriate title."
I kinda liked it. I didn&#39;t like that it was a musical but it was a nice musical.
Its not them its us. Maybe were just done with Hollywood. Its regurgitation on film. Nothing original. On top of the continual leftists propaganda
"Joker was a good movie, but a bit like Taxi Driver in terms of plot."
Wayne‚Äôs World 2
you saved me 20 bucks thank u
Die Hard.
This is the best review of the film I have heard.
"Stop making movies best suited for man-hating lesbians. Unless it&#39;s a sugar coated, pink fluffy cloud of a chick flick, movie audiences basically consist of mostly men, with a sprinkling of women &quot;paid to tag along&quot;. It&#39;s similar to the crowd for &quot;an outrageous comic&quot; - men and their girfriends who begrudgingly tagged along without paying for their own ticket. The money comes from men. That is the audience you need to cater for when making anything that is not a chick flick or some &quot;Girl boss fantasy flick&quot; for that man-hating crowd. When ANY opportunity is used to turn anything into those girl boss movies, they can thank themselves for their losses. Idiots."
"Alien was not supposed to have a sequel. However, many people believe Allen&#39;s is better"
When I heard lady gaga in it ages ago I said to myself please don&#39;t make it woke but didn&#39;t know just how bad it is that I cried with rage because now they have ruined his joker now üò¢
Everyone hated the Paris Olympic opening ceremony.  Lady Gaga (stupid name) sang a number in bad french in that. This movie sucked. Lady Gaga sang a number in it. There are no coincidences when investigating a crime.
"Top Gun Maverick was an excellent sequel, maybe even better than the first Top Gun movie"
Nobody can pronounce? Because the only language in the world is English right?
"Phoenix &amp; Gaga did it very good, but the story flopped and that&#39;s why Joker didn&#39;t need a sequel."
"fooly a doo Matt ? really? Given there are 320 millions french speaking on the planet, i&#39;m pretty sure someone can pronounce it lol"
"Our wallets tell a story, its called go woke, go broke.<br>It‚Äôs the gift that keeps giving to people like Todd."
"When I saw all the photos of Gaga posing happily with that Dylan Mulvaney creature, I started hoping this movie would flop badly.<br>Dreams do come true!  üòÜ"
Home Alone 2... they cheated but they made a very successful movie
Aliens was far better than Alien.
Terminator 2 is the only exception
"It was sh!t, he gets graped and the ending was lazy."
Does it have anything to do with it being released as your movie hits the theaters?
Ricky Gervais played a charcter in Extras who hated his own fans as they were the wrong type of fans.
Aliens is the only non-originally planned sequel that did well
No way am I ever watching this üí© of a sequel I‚Äôve heard enough I don‚Äôt even need to hear Matt‚Äôs opinion
"As long as Warner Bros has DC rights, we will not have any good Movie. They had the best Superman with Cavell and F it up. For some reason they threw the hero movies away and started villain movies and series. Villains as heroes. What psychopaths"
Neverv planned on watching it. So thank you for ruining it lol.
"I haven&#39;t even watched the first one. Just no interest it. In the first film it already seems like a dumbing down of the character, even just by watching the trailers."
"Don&#39;t piss in someone&#39;s boots and tell them it&#39;s raining. That&#39;s what they&#39;re doing: they&#39;re purposefully insulting you for liking the first one, but they want you to pay for it and say you liked it to boot. And if you don&#39;t they try to gasslight you. How dare they lecture anyone about morals after every scandal  coming out of Hollyweird in the last decade."
The first joker sucks so im not surprised
I hated the first one just cause of the ending
Saw the first one because of all the hype and thought it was boring. No way I&#39;m going to see 2. Who wants to see a lady gaga movie...
The exception is: Back To The Future II
Of course it&#39;s *33*.
Grease 2 was a classic
‚ÄúThe first one was good!‚Äù - the Todd Phillips filmography
"This film was over budget by $190,000,000‚Ä¶on an awful musical. I mean this is literally a musical that is atrocious."
That&#39;s a good point. Sequels that are preplanned is true.
"Sorry man but you should never tell people the ending of a movie . Amateurish behaviour mate , basically that‚Äôs not ok ."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> Terminator 2"
The movie has a lot to say about exploitation as entertainment and adulation of  psychopathy. It&#39;s also funny. The audience wanted another Deadpool.
PEDOWOOD SUCKS!
‚ÄúJoker 2‚Äù is ‚Äúthe poop that took a pee‚Äù -South Park episode summary of joker 2
"Here&#39;s the question I have, was the first movie really that great? And which audience really appreciated it? <br>I finally watched it about a year ago. It was OK. At least it didn&#39;t put me to sleep. But it&#39;s not something I&#39;ll ever return to. And i wonder, when it premiered, if it didn&#39;t get on the hype train and got lots of viewers, but is it still that important to them? I think it was a hit with some people because they saw it as a &quot;serious&quot; commentary on how someone goes mentally insane. When i watched it, it was hard for me to take it that seriously. And even if the sequel had good ratings, I wasn&#39;t interested."
The problem is that the movie was not a real Joker movie. He is suppose to be the prince of chaos but instead is a sift wimp.
just from the brief summary here if i read the script it would be an instant <b><i>&quot;NO&quot;</i></b>
Aliens and Terminator 2 - but my theory is those did well because they flipped the genre (Horror to Action)
This movie is an attempt to kill off the cult of the joker.
These are the only comments with substance other videos just had folks talking sht without specifics I myself enjoyed both movies 10 bucks for a DC shroom trip yes porfa
"If hollywood could stop ruining good established movies with shitty remakes and terrible sequels, that would be great."
Aliens and terminator stand out as exceptions
"These people in charge of Hollywood were raised by the iPad, lack social skills because they‚Äôre phone zombies and likely have never raised a family or experienced loving another person. They lack humanity and are as much human as the devices and apps they‚Äôre addicted to. Thats why movies and tv today feel like they were made by robots. Because they are."
Everything from hollywood Disney is a disappointment
"Fuck it. I&#39;m actually gonna let you ruin this for me because I genuinely don&#39;t give a fuck. I stopped caring about this movie the second they announced it was a musical starring Lady fucking Gaga. Go on, give us the spoilers!!"
"I think the movie director this time was Indian, cus most of it was musical"
"The movie was okay,not nearly as bad as the new Marvel movies."
Its a musical
"It&#39;s tanking.  Rotten tomatoes low af, garbage movie.  Absolute garbage."
"In joker 3, lizzo as hq will bully joker with all kind of -isms and -phobes."
"I loved the first movie and  I was very confused how it made so much money and why was it so popular,<br>now I know why, the audience didn&#39;t noticed what the first movie was doing<br>&quot;this movie has no narrative justification for existing but it&#39;s also acts as a direct repudiation of it&#39;s own audience.&quot;<br>the first movie did exactly the same only the end was very flashy and people only liked it for that<br><br>no narrative justification:<br>he was looking for his father the whole time<br>-he didn&#39;t figure out who his father was instead he killed his mom<br>he wanted to be a comedian<br>-and when gets a chance for a big break on the talk show he kills the host<br>he had a relationship with a beautiful woman<br>- sike, he imagined it and it was heavily implied he killed her too.<br><br>direct repudiation of it&#39;s own audience<br>-the long pain laugh all the way till the end, <br>-the ultra violence for no reason most of the time<br>-confusing non-sensical scenes: climbing into the fridge., just watching him in his underwear on the sofa laughing.<br>-the comedy club was named pogo after a serial killer IRL<br>-the famous stair dance everyone was copying on a GARY GLITTER song and the movie made it a hit<br><br>the first movie was trolling the audience just like the 2nd only on the first 99 percent missed it <br>so they made the sequel spell it out for you<br>-stupid title<br>-looney toons intro<br>-it&#39;s musical with Gaga<br>the joke was on you the whole time it just took you 2 movies to notice<br>also loved the 2nd one btw.<br><br>these movies were meant to be &quot;American phycho &quot; not &quot;the dark knight&quot;<br>if you have to explain a joke, there is no joke"
"the movie sucks so much that it isn&#39;t possible to watch the full 8 min review, i&#39;m out"
"Also the first one was the baddest Joker Film ever ... completely bs story, no DC Verse ... <br><br>Just Woke Bullshit"
It should not have been made. Time to read the room again
The Godfather Part II is the only great example of an unplanned sequel. Puzzo and Coppola made it a character study with generational allegories between Vito and Michael.
Hbo MAX pushing the Joker 2 ad every couple of minutes during shows just seems even meaner now
My cat just jumped out the window.
Star wars empire strikes back was an unintender sequel and it&#39;s the best film in the franchise
i&#39;m french and i don&#39;t understand wtf would they title it in french? it doesn&#39;t make any sense
Why does a studio shot courtroom drama cost more than a worldwide superhero cgi blockbusters?
hot take joker 1 wasn&#39;t even that great
"The popular Back to the Future unplanned sequels would be examples of your exceptions. But the fact that these, and Aliens and T2, were so long ago proves your point."
"Another clunker appears to be Kevin Costner‚Äôs latest opus.Sank like a <a href=""http://brick.how/"">brick.How</a> come?"
"It‚Äôs not a musical it‚Äôs madness, I realise if you get you get it, this is what mental illness is  in your head, total mishmash, it is very clever and clearly the general public don‚Äôt use their imagination anymore. My opinion ü§î"
I&#39;m amazed that a conservative can say this movie sucks despite it being one about the need to take responsibility for your actions regardless of how you have been treated in life.
Terminator 2 is an/the exception to the rule I think.
was empire strikes back planned before star wars? if not probably the exception to the rule.
It was just woke. We need a conservative right wing joker.
"Should have made the sequel about The Joker being able to to Fly, and he like flys across the Atlantic and goes on mad journeys in the Middle East and like drops grenades on people."
It&#39;s a musical- was the death knell for 80% of men.Lady gaga finished off the stragglers.üòä
Yeah the only second movie that was good and not planned at all was Jeepers Creepers 2. Just as good if not better than the first. But that&#39;s the only one I can think of.
For those of you who dont speak French. It means &quot;folly are due&quot;.
"Maybe they tried to &quot;subvert expectations,&quot; but missed badly."
"I was all set to go, had the day planned üòÉ‚Ä¶ then I heard the reviews. üôÅüëéüèª<br>Took my movie money, went out to eat instead. üçîüçüü•§üòãüëçüèª"

You know what&#39;s great so far? Penguin on Max
People can pronounce the title correctly.<br>Knowing your own limitations is important and helps you to improve. Keep practicing your pronunciation of this French term Mat. You will get there!üëç
"Don&#39;t do musicals.<br>Hate them with a passion, so it was a non starter for me anyway."
I liked Joker 2 ‚ù§
&quot;Folding a Duece&quot;
The Godfather 2 was not planned with the first one
thing is though now people will go see it to see how bad it is lol
"All involved have said it&#39;s not actually a musical, and Todd Philipps said &quot;it&#39;s a film infused with music, but falling short of being a conventional musical.&quot; But the fact that Joker: Folie √† Deux is musical themed puts me off ever watching it; I don&#39;t want to watch the Joker singing."
the genius of making a villain origin story and killing the character before he even encounters the hero ü§¶üèª
"Me and my friend watched this film, it was SO boring. Every time we thought it would finally end it kept going. We had to walk out near the end. It was very difficult to sit through."
"Wouldn&#39;t even see it after seeing the preview. The Harley Quinn and joker story was built on Stockholm syndrome with Harley being a therapist in Arkham and joker seeing, abusing and extorting her personal weaknesses."
Making it a musical was their first mistake
I guess Matt didn&#39;t have a decent topic for today so he just did a rant about something everybody knew already (that Joker 2 sucks) üòÇ
"I loved the first movie, thought it was (and is) more or less a masterpiece. Was looking forward to this one, and came away extremely disappointed, broadly speaking on 2 counts. I thought Joachim Phoenix was masterful as always, Lady Gaga good but under-utilised as an actress, a handful of minor plot things (easter eggs, mostly) very good, but my main 2 gripes are:<br><br>1. I&#39;m no fan of musicals, but love music and can dig a movie that riffs on music. A lot, potentially. Todd Phillips said in interviews &quot;It&#39;s not a musical, it uses music&quot; (I paraphrase). Spoiler alert: It&#39;s a musical. The tunes are well-chosen in terms of lyrical themes, but they&#39;re also used to try to cover up the fact that so little actually happens in the film, plot-wise. Frankly, it baffles me.<br><br>2. The key thing is that Matt has almost word-for-word expressed what I had to say to my partner after we&#39;d just seen the film. As I said to her: &quot;I feel like I&#39;m being punished for liking the first film so much. That I am being identified as some kind of &#39;toxic fan&#39; for understanding / liking / relating to themes in the first film&quot;). Nice to know I&#39;m not the only one who felt that way."
Kung fu panda sequels were pretty good
Joker: Madness of 2.<br>Cost: heaps.<br>Made: bugger all.<br>Review: It sucks.
Tbh I didn&#39;t even enjoy the first one that much... ü§∑üèª this one doesn&#39;t seem to deserve the bandwidth to illegally download it and the time wasted to watch it.
You didn&#39;t review the movie........this was the usual dirge on the state of Hollywood film making.
"Aliens - this time, it&#39;s war."
He should had just continue the Joker storyline as the first one instead of trying to make a antsy film.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=200"">3:20</a> Deadpool"
they need to re-screen joker 1 to have a hope of making their money back. there was a distinct lack of collagen injected distractions in that movie
people are bored of projects piggy-backing female characters onto the success of male characters.
I think this video is 7 minutes longer than necessary.
"Even Joaquin Phoenix called it horrible. Unsurprisingly, Lady Gaga loved it. xD"
"Saw it last night. Came away wondering why? There could be a good story, it ended when we saw  Lady Gaga. Why? It‚Äôs a mystery. How? It‚Äôs a mystery . Joker 2? It is a mystery"
when matt walsh reviews movies I take him less seriously
"Title kinda a turn off. I took French for 4 year. I know Lady Gaga like to occasional her song, with French verse. I just find it difficult to NOT imagine movie with Lady Gaga, NOT gonna be a biopic about her, on some level. I like the acting talent, today. Just a LOT of movie, tv, PLUS streaming with own movie and tv, out there. If I a kid, this an exciting time. But. As adult, I find if I can find 3 movie a year, it win win, cuz I repeat watch. Next for me &#39;Furiosa&#39; which streaming on Max. But I gotta lot of gaming to do, before movie time. Thx for review/heads up on Joker 2."
Terminator 2 was not a planned sequel. <br>* greatest sequel ever
"It‚Äôs is a disaster it‚Äôs a suicide, the worse Hollywood movie ever made, I just feel sorry for phoenix his talent just got wasted, this movie should win an award the worse movie of the decade"
The money Hollywood lost this year could have solved world hunger.
You lost me at musical.
Terminator 2 is an exception to your rule
The first one also sucked.
22 jump street was as good if not better than it‚Äôs predecessor
Bladerunner 2049 is an outlier in terms being a great sequel.
The question is ...Why dont the producers KNOW HOW BAD A FILM IS?....Dont they keep an eye on how things are going ? Do they just go &quot; ok its crap release it anyway?
"Terminator 2 is an exception. It wasn‚Äôt planned in the beginning and was a remake (of sorts) framed and told as a continuation.<br><br>And it is an all-time great film, if not the GOAT of films."
Hollywood deep Fake Cinema
Best part is the end making sure no third joker movie
"As just a regular English fella it doesn&#39;t matter of your straight,  gay, black or white. Shite hollywood is shite"
This movie was doomed to suck. Pmsl üòÇüòÇ
What political message were they trying to push with this movie?
Todd Phillips pimped out my mom in chicago in the early 90s
Alians
"Superman II oddly enough... and that&#39;s considered the best movie of the Christopher Reeve era....and honestly, like joker, they should have quit while they were ahead..."
"White lotus season 2 wasnt planned, yet turned out even better than season 1. Its not a movie but in some sense that makes it even more impressive."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> - Aliens, bro. Aliens. Terminator 2. The Dark Knight. Rocky 2. Toy Story 2. Top Gun Maverick... You&#39;re not racist, but not a movie entendeur either."
Star Trek Wrath of Khan exceeded the original but was not planned ahead of time.  I freely acknowledge that it probably doesn&#39;t fit your argument as it came from a long-standing franchise from another medium.  It was not just good trek - - it was good cinema.  Normally I would now tell you to &quot;live long and prosper&quot; but that would make me appear as too much of a geek.
Hollywood in preachers season. They are the righteous ones!
"Last week I got talked into seeing the thing.  It was a long night, having to  sit through this flop.  I have not seen anything this bad since watching &#39;A Day Without A Mexican&#39; and that was back in 2003. The only reason why I chose to suffer through the whole movie was out of a sense of sociability."
"&quot; I know what , everyone will love a musical if we make it&quot;<br><br>Sure bro"
Joker 2 is trash
"The french can pronounce it: Fol√≠ a d√∂ (√∂ ~ir like on girl, world or sir). So it is fo-lee ah dir."
It wasn‚Äôt that bad. The first movie was about a victim of society becoming violent and vengeful and getting praised for it. The second movie asked the question about whether becoming violent Is a justifiable response to being victimised - the answer - no. I didn‚Äôt like the first movie because it made joker out to be an angry social justice type of anarchist. And I like the second movie for not further glorifying violence and turning him into some clown version of George Floyd and actually posing deep moral questions. Yeah the court room drama was a bit boring and the musicals were a bit much. But it wasn‚Äôt swayed into further romanticising him as a sympathetic villain. That isn‚Äôt the message you want to put out to people
"Terminator 2, Aliens..."
Matt is a veritable word smith
Because its too cliche. Part 2 oh let&#39;s see what we give him. A girlfriend. Oh guess what a baby is coming for part 3. So predictable and totally opposite from the first.
I offer Grease 2 as an example of a great movie. It was not part of the original creator&#39;s plan from the beginning.
Next movie idea ‚Äòam I a flat earthist?‚Äô
"The movie is not bad. The narrative built around it, is not in good faith.<br><br>It&#39;s different from the first, but taking his mental illness into account, the song and dance makes sense.<br><br>Loved the first, very King of Comedy/ Taxi Driver. But the second movie deals with the consequences of his actions plus his further slide into mental illness."
Wolverine and Deadpool sucked too
America truly is a cultural wasteland. You can&#39;t even put a French word in a film title or put a musical number in it without people kicking off.
People from Hollywood gaslight themselves to think that Joker was alt-right pro men movie so they feel the need to undo first movie
"Matt, you should have watched &quot;Am I Racist&quot; if you want to see real life actual jokers."
Joker 2 as name and no joker insideüòâ worst movie  of Phoenix  ever
Aliens &amp; Terminator 2.
But you guys don&#39;t care about Hollywood right? That&#39;s like one of the lame shticks you all do. So why the f*ck do I care what you think about it?
Joke&#39;s on him: Folly of a Douche.
How about The New Testament?  That was better than the original.
"Terminator 2, Aliens, That&#39;s about in in terms of sequels better than the original. Havent seen Godfather."
I can see why Matt feels that a more conservative take would help this film!
"I haven‚Äôt seen a sequel with such contempt for its audience since Exorcist II The Heretic! Ay, caramba!"
"Hollywood, courted by the elites as their propoganda arm, now believe it can tell people what they will like, rather than ask, They have become gods in their own minds."
If you treat the word ‚Äúfolie‚Äù‚Äôas a faux ami (from the perspective of a learner of French) - then this movie‚Äôs title perfectly sums up what this movie‚Äôs problem is - the ‚Äúfolly‚Äù of a second one !
"I agree with everything you said, except... if you want a sequel as good or better than the original, then look no further than Terminator 2."
It was mid
"After Napoleon, i dont trust phoenix. Shall i pay 15¬£ hmmmm"
"Well‚Ä¶ I liked it. Not a fan of it being a sort of musical, which I believe should have been more clear on the marketing, but as a long time Batman fan, I love the Joker and I‚Äôm a sucker for the character."
The director was just trying to get invited to the Catalina wine mixer after they blackballed him for the first movie.
So sad. Joker 1 was so dang good!
It was made to suck.  That is why WB will sue.
"The communist DEI/LGBTQIA+ agenda has literally been in many TV series and movies, even sneaking the scenes in later in the movie or in later episodes. It&#39;s disgusting and ruins the entire presentation. Speaking of far left Lady Gaga, she was in a part of the American Horror Story series, which heavily pushes the homosexuality and woke agendas."
"Wow!!!  Matt Walsh, you sir just did the opposite. If the movie was that bad and you telling us the gist and the ending is the best ever rendition of Joker 2. I thank you sir."
I didn&#39;t think it was so bad. I&#39;d give it 7/10.<br><br>Despite flaws it has excellent performances by the two leads. It&#39;s not really had.
Matt and his age group grew up on super hero movies. How sad.
A lady gaga musical?  Nope
Rocky 2 was a good sequal
After the first one accidentally resonated with so called &quot;incels&quot; you knew they weren&#39;t going to let that happen again. They&#39;d rather destroy the franchise. If you don&#39;t think movie studios are willing to lose money at the box office to do this just look at some of what Disney and Marvel have done lately with movies that used to primarily appeal to male audiences.
I liked it
Fast and Furious 2 was the BEST unplanned sequel.
"Generally speaking, with a sequel, you can go for broke, in the hope of the anointed and desirable franchise, or you can rush something out, and capitalise on the original. Either way, you would expect to make a bit of money. <br>Batman Returns, springs to mind, as a failed sequel (whether it made money, I don&#39;t know), because the Director was given a huge cheque, and allowed his head."
Todd Philips you dipüí© you ruin the first one by  Arthur Fleck is not the Joker. <br>Director hate the audience that ‚ù§ the original film. <br>I would just make believe this sequel doesn&#39;t exist.<br>for my sanity <br>üòÇüòÖ
I loved it. The amount of hate is so unecessary.
"Contrapoint: Terminator 2 wasn&#39;t planned, and it was even better than Terminator"
The first Joker movie was garbage
"I dont like the first one. Its depressing sh1t. And that isnt the original story of the Joker. Tell ya what, they wont make The Killing Joke, tell ya that much."
A movie making the bad guy into a hero is by default a garbage movie.
I want my money back. Absolutely one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen intentionally.
Terminator 2
cant wait for this guys sequel AM I RETARDED?
Thanks for taking one for the boys.
"Why did Lady Gaga sang while putting on makeup? Is it some kind of Western plot device? As an Asian movie goer, that part was weird."
Unexpected sequel years after the first that was a success?<br><br>Um... 2010?
Bride of Frankenstein is also an exception to the rule.
I love listening to lady Gaga voice. I hate seeing Harley Quinn signing.
"Its official, Matt canceled joker folia duken(or whatever its called.)"
"There&#39;s lots of great horror sequels and b movies in general tend to fare better with sequels. Not every movie needs to be a work of art, well made entertainment is good enough sometimes."
üëç
Tarrifier 3 is going to make a much bigger profit.
"Oh man... under a minute in and i am already realizing how far away from mainstream i am... not only have i not heard that this movie was coming out this weekend, i didnt even know this movie was being made. I never saw the last joker, but i did hear about it before it released."
Anything with French in the title must be a pathetic pretentious gay movie. Change my mind
"I concur ‚Äî subject movie was indeed, quite bad. Being an AMC A-List member, I fortunately didn‚Äôt pay money to see it.  I didn‚Äôt see the first movie (nor do I plan on), so I can‚Äôt compare the two either."
"At least Megalopolis, despite being a flop, was a labour of love for Francis Ford Coppola. For Todd Phillips, Joker Folie a Deux was a labour of hate."
"I liked it. Ending didn‚Äôt work but it was enjoyable throughout the rest, I guess I don‚Äôt mind musicals and courtroom dramas."
The Joker 2 became a joke on its own‚Ä¶a lame one at best.
"Slow news week, huh?"
Surely you learn French in American schools
Shanghai knights best sequel movie
A24 is the company producing the best films in recent years. Based in New York. An amazing list of quality movies. Check them out.
Folly a DOO üòÇüòÇüòÇ<br>Its hardly advanced Latin. <br>Its 1 word and a well known phrase.<br><br>I thought you Americans were big on pronouncing things correctly right now. Ask Cameler.
"I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not going to the cinema to watch it, I&#39;m tired of this cinema culture."
"I hope there are some good deleted scenes, and they rework the whole film based on that, as it was a big letdown, in my opinion."
"‚ù§ People want real heroes, ones that inspire you to do better than you are doing. And lucky, if you get the girl. And the girl gets the guy. And loved babies are made to love.‚ù§"
"Nothing but shite in Hollywood these days or Disney either. Everyone is brain dead. To Disney, I would say pick up a damn Grimms Fairy Tale book and use your effing imagination! Humpty Dumpty‚Ä¶nowhere does the fable say it is an egg. You guys just lazy and stupid."
The first one was terrible already
Awful film the warning sign is lady Gaga
It sucked because for no good reason they made it a musical and not even a good musical hell I&#39;ll watch a musical if I knew it was a musical but when you go in expecting a dark adventure like the first one and instead you get corny musical numbers then its almost a personal insult to my time and wallet
"MATT THE REAL MVP, MOST OF US WALKED OUT üòÇ"
It wasn&#39;t great honestly....like.....totally not necessary and there was so much they could have done but they just destroyed the whole character and premise. It&#39;s sad. üò¢
I can pronouce it easy. lol
"Its a great movie with a superb counter cultural message.  Joker sees through the shallowness of fame and wants to be his true self.  Its not for everyone, but its superb."
I haven&#39;t been to a movie in 20 years and I haven&#39;t missed a thing.
Good man
Terminator 2 is the exception.
Terminator 2 is the only Sequel to truly destroy the first one.
This movie cant even get views on Illegal streaming sites
Terminator 2 is arguably the best sequel ever !
Who knew that no1 cares about musicals... Well I never
"Another question I‚Äôd like Matt to answer is why is the film industry creating such dark, deprived materials as a vehicle for mass commercial entertainment?  I don‚Äôt care how good and meaningful the story is whether that‚Äôs the original or the sequel.  Something is seriously wrong when we have a society that consumes this stuff en masse."
What has this to do with pamela harris?  Why aren&#39;t you bein mean to pamela harris?
Im not watching -  I can just tell its all about Gaga.  Absolute joke (mind the pun).  The first one was brilliant.  Harley Quinn wasnt even that big of a character for Joker in the comics.
"Well Matt this was dissapointing...i held you in high regard review vise...well in general how constructive in criticizm you can be at given topic.... yet you choose to bandwagon the Joker 2 bashing train, and to sum it up you did only that. This video contains 20 seconds talking about actual movie...underlying themes of this movies are post world war 2 neo liberalism, rise of the pure capitalism...social capital decline... victim psychology.... narcisistic behaviour... empathy starvation... idolisation... psychopat idealisation... and a lot more... god forbid mention tragic love...but... yeah...people think it has nothing in it but singing and money grab. You are documentary maker yourself... quite good one in my opinion, you should have done better on this one. Best regards"
"T-2 was one of the best ever.  And the Sarah Connor tv series was great, except that it was matriarchist."
"Musicals do NOT exist in real life. Musicals are the most hated movies. LA LA Land, a musical, was voted best movie...go figure."
"I don&#39;t think the movie hates its own audience, I honestly find that to be a bit of a shallow interpretation. What happens is that the real life audience of this movie mirrors Joker&#39;s fans in the movie. We expected to get a movie about Arthur embracing his Joker persona, the same way his fans in the movie did. The movie does not live up to those expectations and shows us more of the broken man behind said persona, but that&#39;s not what we wanted to see. So we stab the movie to death, so to speak.<br>I find this whole outcome quite interesting."
It&#39;s shouldn&#39;t have been made.
"i think that the movie makes sense... there was not supposed to be a sequel  but i asked the question, what happens to arthur next? and honestly.. im satisfied with the answer.. it could have been anything i dont care..  everyone was expecting a prison break and him turning into the joker of course.. and that literally happened in the movie.. but... the character arthur fleck stayed in character the whole time.. the whole lady gaga thing is whatever but i honestly like it if you think about her portrayal as harley quinn i honestly wasnt even thinking of her as that character until eventually i was like oh yeah shes supposed to be harley quinn.. shes just some crazy girl in a prison and then it turns out shes a rich girl who just wanted to get close to the sensation that is joker through the media and she lies to do so.. instead of it being the comic book sequel we were all hoping for they made it a realistic next stage.. yeah hes just some guy who did some crazy stuff and so yeah now hes in prison facing the consequences.. thats what happens to him.. you wanted to know.. this is what happens.. all of you are saying you didnt ask but i did ask.. im also the reason the movie solo exists and i think you should watch that movie because i think youll like it.."
Moon landing was fake
I enjoyed Rush Hour 2 and Bad Boys 2 more than originals.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=185"">03:05</a> I agree with the overall point.  Outliers are almost non existent.  Terminator 2 is one such rare outlier."
"Aliens, (Alien 2) was as good as the first one. Just saying."
"BOTH joker movies suckkkked... they changed the whole premis of the joker. He was a criminal mastermind with a touch of sinister humor,  not a mentally unstable leftie."
"Haven&#39;t seen it, don&#39;t plan to."
I planned on not watching that ish!
"What a strange concept; &#39;honest review&#39; ??- Why would you do a review that is the opposite ? Is there an honest and a dishonest version of this ? Are you suggesting that a lot of the reviews out there is &#39;fake&#39; or &#39;paid for,&#39; or the like? Doesn&#39;t seem like it with that Rotten score... or are you saying that everything else you do isn&#39;t honest?  Is it, in reality, a way of trying to make your review stand out from all the others saying the exact same thing? ¬†This review only exist because you are running a channel, with 3,05 milllion subscribers. That is it&#39;s sole reason for being ! <br>- Here is a suggestion if you want to stand out; play your review on the banjo that is standing in the background (which is strange in its own right; why is it there? You obviously don&#39;t like musicals..), and stop capitalising on the word &#39;honest&#39;... My review of your review (cause that&#39;s all that it is)"
"I really liked the first one. But once i heard the second one was gonna be a musical and lady caca was gonna be in it, I lost all interest in seeing it."
Went to see it with my girlfriend. We suffered through the first 30-40 minutes and then left. It&#39;s really bad.
"Rocky 1, 2, 3 and 4 were all progressively better. Beyond that there&#39;s definitely very few examples of sequels getting better"
"Aliens is an example of a truly amazing unplanned sequel, maybe the best"
LOTR
"I believe Jocker 2 is as bad as a fart after Taco Tuesday but the entire storyline is safe. It would make more sense if you imagine for a second that the director of the movie is Tarantino... you know how that works don&#39;t you? The devil is in the detail of the timeline... if you watch the end of Jocker (the last scene after the night of anarchy in Gotham), he&#39;s in Arkaham with his psychiatrist and he kills her, you can tell by the blood on his footprints when he walks on the corridor. Well, if you count the number of people he killed that will make 7 (3 drunks on the train, 1 with the midget, 1 on TV, 1 mum, 1 psychiatrist) ... in Jocker 2 he&#39;s always acused of killing 5 (not counting his mum) so the entire Jocker In Brodway movie happens after Anarchy Night and before he ends in Arkaham with the psychiatrist. Conclusion, the entire story didn&#39;t happen at all, it was just something he imagined, same as his relationship with Sophie in the first movie. Another argument that supports this theory is that in Jocker In Brodway, he&#39;s not the psychopath maniac he was at the end of the first movie but the wimpy character he was at the beginning of the movie. Lastly, so you can sleep well tonight... where in the world a Supreme Court Judge will allow a maniac to defend himself wearing a clown costume??? he definitely imagined if not the whole story, 95% of it, probably he met Harley the first time he was transferred to Arkaham but that was all, and when he&#39;s stabbed at the end, it&#39;s when the story rolls back to reality and he starts laughing with the psychiatrist... laughing about how stupid would be to die that way after everything he did... that&#39;s why he says to her &quot;you wouldn&#39;t understand&quot; and kills her just because &quot;it&#39;s fun&quot; for him."
"Dark knight rises was a phenomenal movie, but it might fall under the pre planned story."
One unplanned sequel that was actually good and arguably better than the original: Aliens
Top gun??
top gun maverick is one of those rare sequels that are actually pretty good despite not being planned originally (just mentioning it be cause Matt couldn&#39;t recall any good title that nailed being a good sequel)
I thought Joker 2 was a fascinating character study. I liked that it wasn&#39;t a copy of the (epic) first film. I wish they could&#39;ve limited the singing though. Seemed out of place most of the time.
Terminator 2 was better than the first one.
why did this movie have a 190 million dollar budget? did 150 million dollars go to lady gaga and her dance company? tick tock tick tock.. im guessing the answer is yes...
"Probably the only sequels that were not planned but ended up being as fantastic as the original are Aliens, Terminator 2 and Back to the Future II."
I think both are perfect
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=178"">2:58</a> Wrong.  Aliens and Terminator 2."
"It wasn&#39;t as bad as everyone said (and this is coming from a guy that hates musicals) but I was well prepared for it to suck when I went in. The songs only went for about 90 seconds, which was bareable but I mourn what could have been. I saw maybe a Fight Club style movie where the Joker leads a Project Mayhem style anarchy group...however it was never going to be that sort of film."
It was liked by straight white men so it had to be destroyed.
Shrek 2... shrek was not expected to be a huge success and thus shrek 2 was just made for the sake of supplying more shrek content. But it was a great movie! More memorable than the first in my opinion.
S squad sucked joker sucked we already knew this was gonna suck as soon as I heard it was a musical that didn&#39;t fit the scenes at all I wasn&#39;t wasting my money I didn&#39;t like the first one
T2: Judgement Day
"i‚Äôm actually surprised matt didn‚Äôt like it. yes, the movie criticizes the audience. because we are just like the crazed fans of the joker in the movie, we only care about the joker as a symbol, and disregard the suffering of the man. so, as soon as arthur fleck renounces that the joker, just like his fans, we turn on him. because, nobody cares about the man, they push this clearly mentally ill man to basically sabotage his whole life, and push away the only people that actually want to help him. then when he actually does something noble, by taking accountability for his actions, they turn their backs on him. it‚Äôs actually kind of beautiful, and the fact that the audience has done exactly that in response to this film for that very reason, because they wanted THE JOKER but what they got was arthur fleck,  well, i found it to be poetic and very telling of us as a society. we are the mad ones. we identify with arthur fleck, and get catharsis from the joker, because it‚Äôs so easy for us to see ourselves as the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù rather than the problem. am i crazy, did i just like think way too much into this movie? why am i the only one defending it?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=166"">2:46</a><br>Terminator 2 is one of the exceptions to that rule. Back to the Future 2 was also pretty good - not better but it didn&#39;t bomb either.<br>Aliens (after Alien) is also an exception.<br>The Naked Gun 2 1/5 was a good sequel.<br>Police Academy 2 to 8 were also pretty funny.<br>Peyton Manning was better than Archie Manning."
"This movie exists? I&#39;ve never heard of this. I&#39;m constantly on the internet and driving around at properties, dealing with tenants, etc, and NOBODY has EVER mentioned this ONE TIME. Did they just skip an entire region? It&#39;s crazy to me that a joker film came out and I found out here."
Its just an odd choice isn&#39;t it. Oh wow that dark origin story movie we made was an unexpected smash let&#39;s make the sequel a musical they will bloody love it
Terminator 2 is a sequel that overshadowed the original
"I agree that most unplanned sequels suck (Fly 2 and Robocop 2, yikes!), but there are some exceptions to the rule, like Terminator 2 and Aliens, which happen to be from the same director, maybe that explains it, I dunno...<br>I haven&#39;t seen Joker 2 yet (and yes I liked Joker quite a bit; I am not a fan of superhero movies but Joker wasn&#39;t really one), but two things that were always a bad sign for me:<br>1. The French subtitle &quot;Folie a Deux&quot; makes it sound pretentious and artsy-fartsy. A bit like those Wall Street idiots in the 1980s going to bars to read poems to other customers (yeah that was a scene from a Tom Cruise movie where I got it, I didn&#39;t know that was a thing).<br>2. While better than Madonna, I don&#39;t like Lady Gaga as an actor. In a way that role fits her as she always seems to like to present herself as &quot;broken&quot; and a bit of a cuckoo, but still her acting just doesn&#39;t work on me. I took my wife to one of her concerts like 10 years ago tho, my wife liked it a lot, I wore hearing protections (not because I hated the music, but it was just too loud, I don&#39;t like concerts, they kill hearing).<br>I will try to see the movie with an open mind at some point, but unfortunately I expect it to be pretentious and artsy-fartsy."
Star Trek II was not planned and far superior.
Aliens and Terminator 2 off the top of my head. <br>Come on Matt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=166"">2:46</a> I know of an exception: Back to the Future Parts II and III"
Top gun maverick and terminator 2
Should watch Terrifier 3. That obliterates Joker 2 in every single way.
"Darn... I actually liked that chick, too. Well, not that it matters to her but there goes what&#39;s left of <i>her</i> career... I just hope this doesn&#39;t tarnish <i>his</i> career too much. I refuse to watch it but hopefully he doesn&#39;t stop with this one."
Terminator 2
"Joker 2 was awful. And I agree with most of what Walsh says. But I do sorta feel like it‚Äôs a bit of a stretch to say that ‚ÄúHollywood hates their audience.‚Äù Maybe. I just think they made a really, really bad movie here. End of story."
"I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the first Joker. The Joker is an elemental villain--he&#39;s more of a spirit or demon, hence why he has no definitive origin. But I&#39;m not a purist. I was willing to entertain a thought experiment where you dream up an origin that might make sense for the Joker we all know as Batman&#39;s archnemesis. But a pathetic, abused whiner doesn&#39;t become that in my mind. STILL, I was willing to go along with another movie showing us how this Arthur Fleck guy becomes Batman&#39;s biggest foe. If they&#39;d kept the original narrative of Harley Quinn as Joker&#39;s psychologist who he manages to manipulate into madness and used that as a stepping stone to becoming the Joker we all know, Joker 2 could&#39;ve been a really interesting film warranting a third part that brings in Batman and completes Fleck&#39;s evolution. It&#39;s such a shame Phillips shit the bed so badly."
"&quot;Hey guys, let&#39;s make a second Joker movie!&quot;<br>-Um... Wait, <i>why?</i><br>&quot;We&#39;ll make it a <i>musical!</i> &quot; <br>-Um... Wait, <i>why?</i><br>&quot;And we&#39;ll put Lady Gaga in it!&quot;<br>-Um... Wait, <i>why?</i><br>&quot;We have a $200,000,000 budget!&quot;<br>-Oh, sure. We can pocket at <i>least</i> $40,000,000 of that. Sure, whatever. Let it rip. Just kill him in the end so we can finally wash out hands of this ridiculous garbage.<br>&quot;Done and done...&quot;"
Lady Gaga took a break from badly imitating Madonna to badly imitate Harley Quinn. I don&#39;t pay for bad impressions.

"Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man‚Äôs Chest is the only example I can think of where an unplanned sequel built on and surpassed the original. The Mummy Returns is another. Bigger and dumber, but more fun and more of a commercial success. It‚Äôs not hard to please the fans. It‚Äôs just that Hollywood producers have no instincts for it."
Rocky ll = best sequel
The Lesson: Hollywood THINKS IT HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL US WHAT WE <b>CAN &amp; CAN&#39;T LIKE.</b>
"I&#39;m going to watch Terrifier 3 instead, who&#39;s with me?"
"I liked the movie, very entertaining and well orchestrated and I also loved the singing."
"Was there a sequel - that was not originally planned - that was as good as the original  ?<br>How about Mad Max 2  (Road Warrior) ?<br><br>Notwithstanding that, I agree that most &quot;unplanned&quot; sequels are a great disappointment."
The Sergio Leone Dollars trilogy was fantastic and is an example of sequels getting even better.
"Godfather 2 absolutely wasn&#39;t planned. Coppola didn&#39;t want to do it. He didn&#39;t even want to do the first one. Watching it, you&#39;d think it was planned, however, as it&#39;s so well written, and the continuity from GF1 is absurd."
Joker 2 Fail a doo doo.
Joker 2 Foolish Doodoo
Home Alone 2 is an exceptionally good sequel.
I don‚Äôt think Terminator 2 and Aliens were planned in advance but both are great.
"Friday, October 4, 2024 - Finally seen Joker Lady Gaga: Folie √† Deux - The Joker&#39;s previous film was a masterpiece and we expected a lot - with, in addition, a genius like Lady Gaga - Joaquin Phoenix Joker + Harley Quinn Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel - by LD after the wonderful Margot Robbie (star of the extraordinary Barbie) - All would be forgiven by a real ending - Like the indescribable horror of The Substance or the multiple absurd endings of B√âTELGEUSE BETELGEUSE - So note to the lazy director: and add scenes with Gaga that are overlooked - cut in the too many and endless scenes of trial and jail and car transport - Send Joker to the electric chair sneering<br><br>The 2 heroes wake up, Joker Gaga, lying in a bed in a fancy hotel with Harley Quinn pregnant and Joker says:  I had a strange dream<br> <br>Note for Matt Walsh: a film is a show, a distraction, a hobby, a collective experience, a work of art ‚Äì 90% failure rate ‚Äì in this film there seems to be a script but also improvisation and collective creation ‚Äì hence this constant impression of daydreaming or hallucination ‚Äì down-to-earth scenes, a complex and serious trial that becomes absurd surrealist Dadaist ‚Äì dance and songs and music<br><br>And there is still a lack of THAT final scene that will sew these bits of film together to make a patchwork or a tapestry<br><br>Currently, we have a failed Frankenstein lying on the ground with his body parts more or less sewn together and dying interminably <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/egJ1XufTKYfegwOo57ewAg""></a>"
That‚Äôs a devastating review üòä
It needs a Director&#39;s Cut like Ayer Cut &amp; every Zack Snyder Cutüòä
J2 had to be a successful failure to please the people who didn‚Äôt even want to see it .   Reading that back to myself makes no fucking sense . üòÇ
"joker 2 sucked. it was a musical, end of story..move on."
It was annoyingly bad.
"I watched videos where hatred of movie comes from those who hate/blame Gunn &amp; people hated on director wanting to copy off Ledger&#39;s Joker in Nolan DK trilogy? Despite showrunners of Gotham copied Nolan&#39;s Joker with that whole cutting a smile on face with their version in Jerome. Matt Reeve&#39;s Joker again a carbon copy of Ledger&#39;s more or less. Thats what im reading, getting from others. I dont know/dont care as i never watched first film nor care to and wont be seeing this one"
Wayne&#39;s World 2 is good sequel to an unexpected hit
"If the joker dies, before even meeting Batman.... then thats just ridiculous script writhing. Surely it should have ended with somekind of connection to the Bat."
For some reason the production company thought the fans of the first film were also upbeat musical theatre fans. üò¨
U can&#39;t say the title because ur a typical American lol.
Boycott HOLLYWEIRD!!!
Aliens and Terminator 2 were I believe unplanned sequels that were at least as good as as the original
Terminator 2 wasn&#39;t planned. The success of the first one was a huge shock. I prefer the first one but most people think the second one is the best.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=181"">3:01</a> back to the future part 2"
Feel sorry for you..hope u get a life
"Hey, what about Jaws 2?!"
"Walsh describes the ending where someone &quot;becomes the NEW joker&quot; granted I haven&#39;t seen the movie, but it sounds a lot more to me like they wrote Phoenixe&#39;s character out for an ACTUAL joker, because as great as PHoenix&#39;s performance was, he had nothing to do with the Joker character as generally understood, aside from being a killer dressed like a clown.. That character would never evolve to be a fully realized JOker, because that wouldn&#39;t be consistent with what they established up to that point. It sounds like they ousted the Phoneix character to solve the problem of it being impossible to progress with him. If you&#39;re saying that sort of thing about a chraacter, he&#39;s the last character who should be getting a sequel"
Shank sales skyrocketed though....go figure!üòÇüòÖ
Avatar was the last good movie I&#39;ve seen in a Theater.
Aliens was a rare case
You‚Äôre a massive flop Matthew
If they sing in this movie and that&#39;s why it was Gaga it&#39;s a true sign of the end of Hollywood. I&#39;ll never know because I&#39;ll never see it.
"I thought the Batman movies in 2008 and 2012 both sucked. Line the actors were reading line sin disjointed scenes. It was incoherent as a movie. I walked out on both. A good movie draws you in, bo contrast...   No Country for Old Men and Gladiator and Apocalypto."
20 years from now it will have a cult following. üòé
This movie is a hate crime on the fans.
It wasn&#39;t that bad. I&#39;ll watch it again and this time pay more attention
Does Matt live on top of the smoky mountains
i demand my overinflated tix price to be refunded...especially my 1hr ( I walked out from this mess hoping for a plot which it&#39;s not!!??) of life wasted!
Joker: The Musical. <br><br>When will Hollyweird ever learn?
Stoopid idea
Instead go to see &quot;Am I Racist?&quot; 11 out of 10.
Everyone: Joker 2 has a gay anal r@pe scene<br>Matt Walsh: <b>knocking everyone out of his way running to the theater</b>
Any movie with Lady Gaga I‚Äôm not interested.
I think Karate Kid 2 might be that one exception you couldn&#39;t think of.
terminator 2 ?
"Two exceptions to &quot;Unplanned sequels suck&quot;: Terminator 2 and Aliens<br>For some reason, the same director.<br>Oh, and Indiana Jones 2 &amp; 3."
Outliers: Empire Strikes Back. Terminator 2.
Aliens and Terminator 2 are probably the only ones
"If I had to guess, the CIA/DHS paid the franchise producers to destroy the franchise. Why? Because the Joker was perceived to stoke rebellion against the regime."
"The problem is that both movies have polar opposite messages.<br><br>The first film shows how a mentally ill man is driven to despair and complete insanity by the repulsive society around him. Despite becoming as twisted as said society, however, he does at least rebel against it for creating him, and the movie questions the responsibility that culture has for the people it creates.<br><br>In the second film, Fleck gets raped by prison guards and (later) murdered by an insane inmate. Instead of implicitly excusing rebellion against a corrupt and twisted society, it&#39;s urging young men to just shut up and take it (literally) and submit to said twisted society. However, the movie is also very schizophrenic, because while it admits that society&#39;s depravity created Fleck, it also places all moral responsibility on Fleck, now making him completely responsible for both his actions and what happens to him and excusing society in the process.<br><br>The Joker series went from being countercultural to embracing the current culture while simultaneously admitting the current culture&#39;s absolute depravity."
Joker 2? Never heard of it until you told me.
"&#39;The Dark Knight&#39; would be an &quot;outlier&quot;, The sequel to &#39;Batman Begins&#39;  Nolan even said that he was not anticipating making a sequel to the movie even though it ended on a cliff hanger. &#39;The Dark Knight&#39; excided expectation by a long shot"
The director of &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; didn&#39;t want a sequel but was forced into it so he decided to just go hog wild and do whatever the f he wanted.  It&#39;s pretty great
Aliens. T2.
"&quot;Aliens&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Alien&quot;, is amazing. Other than that,  nah, churned sequels are rarely good."
"I thought the first movie was good, but the thing about it was that it wasn&#39;t really The Joker meaning it wasn&#39;t a supervillain movie. It was really just a movie about the tragic descent of a man cast aside by his fellow human beings. The &quot;Joker&quot; part was incidental to the plot, but served to sell tickets due to name recognition. There should never have been a sequel."
John Wick was the exception of successful sequels but I don‚Äôt know if they were pre-planned.
I think terminator 2 might have been conceived after the fact and that was better than the original.
What does Robert DeNiro think of it ? He knows a lot about films. üòÆ
Minimal french knowledge helps pronouncing it correctly ...
Lady Gaga actually is a good actor so they could have literally done anything else besides a musical and got a better result that&#39;s how you know it was done on purpose üò¢
"I went to see Joker 2 last weekend and after 45 mins I walked out. Which is something I never do. It was grim, like unrelentingly grim. And the first movie was also grim but it was actually very interesting.  This is just grim and not interesting"
"Sorry Matt, ‚ÄúGodfather Part 2‚Äù was a totally unplanned sequel. Coppola didn‚Äôt want to do it, but the studio ‚Äúmade him an offer he couldn‚Äôt refuse‚Äù. üòÇ Really, that happened."
A TV series is basically a film franchise often consisting of 150 sequels or more.
"Man, I miss Terry Gilliam movies."
It‚Äôs ass and nobody cares about all the extra bullshit dialogue they always throw in these shitty joker movies
Die Hard 3 would be my best example of a great sequel that was not planned during the first movie... And you don&#39;t even have to watch Die hard 2 to enjoy it üòÖ
"Joker 2 sucked because it did the exact opposite of why people liked the first one and it was simply not needed.<br><br>The first one was a dark, gritty and realistic Scorcese-esque character study that effectively showed Arthur&#39;s gradual descent into madness on a relatively modest $70m budget. Here it turns into an overbudgeted two hour Lady Gaga music video and there is zero development in Arthur/Joker&#39;s character. What they should have done instead was show how evil Arthur has become by brainwashing Harley and abusing her...y&#39;know like in the comics. Make it a very uncomfortable commentary on domestic abuse.<br><br>In all honesty, a sequel to Arthur&#39;s story should have been impossible. Before it was suggested that Arthur isn&#39;t THE Joker that fights Batman moreso than he is the INSPIRATION to future Jokers as evidence by the fact that Arthur was significantly older than Bruce in the first movie. By having this sequel, what&#39;s the point in having Joker ship with Harley only to die in the end and a new Joker is born? Is Lady Gaga&#39;s Harley just gonna go gaga for this new Joker and they end up fighting Batman?<br><br>Phillips didn&#39;t plan thos outnat all. Having Bruce be a little boy in the original really backed him into a corner."
"Aliens maybe? Although the first was the best, it got some interesting sequels..."
And here I thought the RoboCop sequels and remake were bad.
"Challenge accepted! I think the best example of an unplanned sequel would be Terminator 2, and that reminds me of the Preditor 2.  I thought it was an excellent sequel, and it dud what Matt suggested was dangerous by changing the setup a lot (jungle vs a sadly realistic modern LA)<br><br>Another example is The Rescuers and The Rescuers 2. I thought it was a great followup and better than the first."
Changing the genre is the real mistake. Imagine if the sequel to dumb and dumber was an action movie that took itself seriously.
Hey Matt just an FYI‚Ä¶<br><br>The 3 best squeals ever made:<br><br>1) Aliens<br>2) Empire Strikes Back<br>3) Lethal Weapon 2<br><br>Agree or disagree?
Top Gun 2 did well but that was 35 years later and they cashed in on nostalgia
"People identified with the disenfranchisement of the joker character...his lack of human connection, being pushed down by society, working hard and getting nowhere. The first movie was apolitical. There wasn&#39;t a single political message in it.Other people have politicized the character.<br><br>The first movie is about a man beaten down and rejected. Possibly living in a delusion of grandeur.We felt sympathy. Not a need to throw rocks and smash cars.There were no riots like some people predicted.The second movie is trying to discredit something that wasn&#39;t there. No one would think to make a taxi driver 2 musical, change the main character then expect it to be as popular as the first."
Dang. The joker dies in a musical. Wild.
"Matt spoke a lot of truth about sequels, they tend to work best when preplanned and not as a cash grab. The 80s was filled with cash grab sequels, and a big part of the problem is that they general don&#39;t share the same look and feel as their predecessor, and the musical score is just as much of the franchise as an actor. <br><br>I don&#39;t dislike them either. To me a TV series is basically a film franchise, and a TV series works because the episodes share the same look and feel, and when the first episode is produced they build in material to handle further adventures."
"&quot;Don&#39;t ask questions, just consume product and then get excited for next product&quot;"
Ha ha. F Hollywood and their garbage films
sing 2 and frozen 2 were better than the first ones.
All lf these exceptions to the rule and not one mention of Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls?<br><br>Godfather 2<br>Aliens<br>Rambo First blood pt 2<br>Terminator 2<br>Ace Ventura 2<br>Top Gun Maverick<br><br>Easy picks for exception to the rule.
"No one wants to see a movie musical at least I don&#39;t, if you like musicals you can go to a Broadway theater or similar and see them there."
"Even being this movie loses money, the amount the first one made compared to budget more than offsets that."
Subtitles: &quot;Walking Phoenix&quot; üòÇ
I‚Äôve always thought ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Batman‚Äù are highly overrated movies‚Ä¶ it looks like the sequels are reaffirming this.
Sounds horrible.  Like every other movie these days.
"Terminator 2, Aliens, Empire Strikes Back. That&#39;s about it."
Musicals already suck.
Why a musical.....why no plot?? Why...just why....
"I didn&#39;t like the first one, and never gonna watch the second one."
Aliens. Infernal Affairs 2 and 3. <br><br>Quite a few.
Joker 2 is a joke ......
"Top Gun Maverick, major exception."
Gladiator 2 next
The joker was killed.  But his half brother batman shall average him! üòÖ
Unfortunately Hollywood hasn`t made a good movie for 20 years They are obsessed with DEI and its ruining movies<br>but worse is that this horrible hollywood disease is infecting movie-making in other countries too<br>Memo to Hollywood Not all men are sexist leering stupid or villianous and not all women are the smartest strongest bravest people in movies. Stop with the propaganda
"I disagree, I dont think this movie is pointless. It has a point but its BAD.<br>They wanna punish and insult the original fans of the first movie in every possible way."
"Here&#39;s a theory: How can these production companies tank for, at least, three straight years, yet somehow stay afloat and apparently, viable? The entire &quot;movie industry&quot; is a money laundering front. It&#39;s like the duck on the pond. At surface level, it&#39;s just a duck floating in a pond (the movie). Yet underneath, that&#39;s where all the criminality occurs. They pump all of this dirty money through the lens, then skate off with the actual profit. The &quot;movie&quot; is quite literally the &quot;look here not there.&quot; Just a thought, but if a regular business operated like this, they wouldn&#39;t last 6 months. How do they lose multi-multi- millions and yet stay afloat? Hell, some (Disney) are talking of expanding major projects to other states! Where&#39;d you get the money??? Everything on the screen has tanked and lost money for the last three years!!!! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Boring! Create some new characters instead of rehashing old washed up ones!
"Idk if they planned ahead for it but, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 was a really good sequel, maybe better than the original."
How about Aliens? A successful movie sequel that was also very successful and not originally planned for
Police academy is the same I like all of them
"What do you mean Your honest review? Do you also have a Dishonest review?<br>How about just using the expression Your review? Because by adding honest it means that you alsi have dishonest ones and, thus, your credibility goes to shit."
Hopefully no ladyballers 2
"I honestly very much enjoyed this film. There‚Äôs no sugar-coating it- the film was an absolute tragedy. <br> If I found any fault with it, it was the running time. For what the film turned out to be, it‚Äôd have benefited tremendously by shaving a good chunk of fat off the entire project, but I could see it being otherwise tolerable in a setting you could pause it and take a breather.<br> Apart from that, it was an amazing film, accomplishing perfectly what it‚Äôd set out to accomplish; allowing the audience to submerge themselves right along with the glamorously horrifying moral descent of its protagonist/antagonist; the Clown Prince of Crime- the visually stunning, musically captivating aspects right along with the gut-wrenching, intolerably cruel realities of consequences. <br> <br> The film begins with a dark cartoon illustrating Arther‚Äôs grappling with the overwhelming shadow resulting from the many traumas he‚Äôs endured throughout his life that motivated him to ultimately commit six murders.<br> Joker, in contrast to Arther, signifies to the entire narrative and character structure the potential for Arther to finally garnish some positive feedback from a world where he‚Äôd only ever been abused or otherwise ignored. <br> In the first installment, we were taken- albeit horrifyingly willingly, if we‚Äôre being honest with ourselves- along with Joker to unleash a world of hurt on his victims in a storm of seemingly justifiable violence. I say ‚Äúseemingly‚Äù because while we all seemed to feel a sadistic release of angst at Joker‚Äôs dealing out vigilante justice upon the society who ‚Äúabandons you and treats you like trash‚Äù , the question we‚Äôre forced to confront in this installment is; can violence be justified? <br> The reason we‚Äôre confronted with this question is, quite unlike the first film, the world releases its seemingly justifiable violence back upon Arther, which will explain the terrible ratings and reviews we‚Äôre seeing pouring in for this film. Nobody wants to see the main character lose, and lose so badly. <br> The audience expected more of the same sadistic pleasure of watching a form of twisted justice doled out to characters who misbehave and mistreat poor Arther; having none of their backstories for what may have motivated them to be such undesirable humans. <br> In that regard, the audience does get the same film, but this time, they know the backstory of the film‚Äôs victim of violence, and rather than receiving sadistic pleasure from seeing terrible actions suffering consequences, we feel sympathy for the victim, and- understanding his history- lament the violence he suffers throughout. And his perpetrators feel justified in their treatment of him the way we‚Äôd felt justified of his treatment of the first film‚Äôs victims. <br><br> Throughout the entire run time, Arther struggles with accepting the consequences of his actions, and teeters between feeling fundamental remorse for his behavior or, otherwise, justifiable defiance at surrendering to his darker, sinister blood-lust. <br><br>  ‚ÄúJoker: Folie √† Deux‚Äù is, to summarize, a haunting masterpiece and a psychological riddle in the way it points a mirror back at the audience asking, ‚ÄúAre you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?‚Äù<br> We receive twice the violence as the original, twice the hurt, twice the glamour, twice the crazy- it‚Äôs a sequel more honoring to its predecessor than I‚Äôve ever personally experienced in cinema, worthy of a second look by a large margin of critics, and will go down as a cult classic in the likes of ‚ÄúA Clockwork Orange‚Äù or ‚ÄúRequiem for a Dream.‚Äù<br> Would I ever watch it again? Maybe. Once or twice. But I already know I‚Äôll never forget it. <br> As I started this review saying- the film was an absolute tragedy, but I think for what it was trying to be, it was successfully so, brilliantly so, and even a bit heartbreakingly so. <br> It‚Äôs not a comfortable watch, but if you go in knowing as much, you might appreciate it for what it is; a daringly unique and richly dark musical tragedy. A chaotically twisted, disturbingly poetic addition to the legend of The Laughing Man."
Wasn&#39;t overly impressed by the first one.<br><br>The Joker isnt actually insane he&#39;s just chaotic.<br><br>Part of the bid to push stereotypes over archetypes.<br><br>Godfather part II is the best sequel.<br><br>Edit; props for the success you&#39;ve had with you&#39;re own film.
"It&#39;s not just this movie, nor woke movies. Cinema is failing, the issue is just being hidden by the cultural movement of woke.<br>Cinema viewers are just not showing up, instead people prefer to stay at home and watch streamed movies on a large screen in the comfort of your own home.<br>Streaming is the new form of cinema, yes there will always be diehards who go but the popcorn is just not enough to bring crowds.<br>Now woke certainly has sped up the death no doubt.<br>It&#39;s like music cds are now not really worth anything and diehard fans will buy vynil.<br>I see it in the same way."
Jack Nicholson is simply the best. I really find this Joker way too mentally problematic.
Boring
Contempt for the audience.     Ruined Dennis days career
I saw the advertising &amp; immediately thought it was not something I&#39;d ever consider  watching.
Alien  Alien 2
As soon as I heard it was a musical I lost all interest. Super hero/comic book movies are dead. I&#39;ll spend my money on Terrifier 3 instead.
Lord of the rings and the hobbits collection comes to mind
The way Matt describes this movie sounds terrible! I would be so disappointed if I paid for it! Thank you for saving me the $$ I didn‚Äôt spend!
Alien and Aliens.  Terminator and Terminator 2.  I think that is the list of good unplanned sequels.
"I really dislike Joaquin Phoenix.<br>  Just like Barbie, I will not watch it.<br>  I was dragged to Black Panther, and it was most pathetic exercise. Even though it was a comic book movie, nothing made any sense."
Thanks
"Je parle francais, so I can easily pronounce the title of this movie.  French is a good White language and I am proud I learned it in high school."
Sequels are almost universally terrible. You can remember the rare exceptions like T2 and Aliens because they are so rare. People really need to stop funding sequels.
It&#39;s official. Hollywood deliberately makes crappy movies because they hate the fans.
if the jokers a flop what would matt(the dumbest man on the planet)walshs film am i racist we already know the answer yes matt your&quot;e a racist mysogynistic peice of crap
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> wasn&#39;t empire strikes back an exception to this rule?"
As soon as I heard gaga was casted as Harley Quinn I knew the direction this film was going to take. Go woke go broke.
"they had so much money, why a court room drama? Where did the money go?"
Good on you Matt for taking the time to review the movie.
Terminator 2 is the best sequel ever.
Just stay home and watch Gladiator and you are guaranteed a good night.
How do you screw up a sequel so bad?.....go woke
‚ÄúSequels always suck‚Äù<br>- Matt ‚ÄúNever seen shrek 2‚Äù Walsh.
Yup. It&#39;s no Gremlins 2.
"Joker 2 was bad but hollywood not making stories worth telling is not true, you just need to watch the right movies. Three billboards, the whale, four good days, and many others."
Matt Walsh&#39;s head looks like a GI Joe with Kung Fu grip. I&#39;ve seen spray on beards that look more real. Matt Walsh is the most generic human claiming to be a man.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=238"">3:58</a>  I‚Äôm stopping at this point because I want to experience my own unbiased reaction."
"Speaking just for me, enough with the comic book movies already,(jezzzzzz)"
X-men 2 was an awesome sequel
"I watched this movie with my wife, and this is THE worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen in my life I went through a litany of negative emotions just for the fact that my time was wasted and I actually payed money to see that pile of crap."
‚ÄúWell the short answer is the movie sucks‚Äù thanks Matt ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇ
Don&#39;t you have any conspiracy theories to spread? Since when are you Roger Ebert?
The trailer was enough for me to take a hard pass.
"I watched Matt Walsh&#39;s movie, same reaction."
"Honestly it didn&#39;t need a sequel, the original movie was perfectly self contained."
Total cultural penetration? üòÆThat sounds like a Diddy party.
I guess the powers that be finally got some dirt on Todd Phillips and took away all his creative rights on this film.
"Terminator 2, Aliens. Both fantastic sequels, not sure if they were written at the same time as the first films."
Quick correction: The Godfather Part II was not planned from the start.  Producers wanted it.
fans of the first film? sounds like a harris voter story. <br>oh wow the polls are banging
Not a thing going on with Donald Trump today? Let&#39;s listen to Matt Walsh piss on on movie that he didn&#39;t make.
James Cameron is the only director who has been able to break the non-intended sequel rule. Aliens and T2 were only conceived after the first ones became classics.
"The only good, unplanned sequel is Ace Ventura 2. While it does repeat many of the jokes of the original, it&#39;s a very funny movie and has some legendary scenes. It&#39;s one of the, if not THE best comedy sequels of all time."
They panicked when they realized they made a movie that made people sympathetic to men&#39;s real world struggle Hence the character assassination.
"Hector is going to be running 3 Honda Civics with spoon engines. And on top of that he just came into Harry&#39;s and he ordered 3 T66 turbos, with NOS, and a Motec system exhaust."
"Matt, I‚Äôve been watching for a while and I find myself agreeing with you 99.9% of the time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.wait‚Ä¶‚Ä¶what?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.have I become my Dad?! I have to see ‚ÄúAm I a Racist?‚Äù I‚Äôll be back in touch. Thanks. SR"
well maybe the real return will be off the bad reviews off youtube
"If they wanted to do a sequel why the hell not just tell the story of the Joker breaking out of the insane asylum and going on a rampage, terrorizing gotham? Makes zero sense to make it so complicated and shitty, haha."
City slickers 2
They could have stopped making movies in the year 2000 and I would still have had a lifetime of movies to watch.  I won&#39;t live long enough to see all the good and the great movies that were made in the 20th Century.  You know the classics but every single year from the advent of the talkies there have been a number of good movies made.  Having seen &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve seen all the good movies that were made in 1934.  Having seen &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve seen all the good movies from 1958.<br><br>So it&#39;s almost irrelevant to me what Hollywood does today.  You mean their still making movies?  Oh.
"I heard online that Joker is raped in the movie. I assumed that the movie ends with him being raped, because everyone says the ending is shocking and disgusting.<br><br>Imagine my surprise when I learn he&#39;s raped in the end of the second act by prison guards, and brutally stabbed to death in the end - and the stabber then slits his own face wide open like Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker in order to take upon the mantle, meaning the entire movie of Joker 1 and Joker 2 was to set up who the &quot;real&quot; Joker is / was.<br><br>Like... wow."
Sometimes an off the cuff sequel could be good.  Like if Matt Walsh or someone else did an <i>Am</i> <i>I</i> <i>Racist</i> <i>2</i> I&#39;d buy a ticket for sure.
How to describe people who worship villains characters in movies? <br>Duffy Duck would say ‚Äúdespicable ‚Äú
Let&#39;s compare this to another bad sequel. Smokey and The Bandit 2 has a Critics Rotten Tomatoes rating of 25% compared to 33% Joker 2. The budget of Smokey and The Bandit 2 was $17M and it earned $66M. The budget of Joker 2 is reported to be $200M. Why the HELL didn&#39;t they launch this into a Batman Movie that people would have enjoyed????
"People, do what I did. Demand something original from your filmmakers:  STOP paying to see prequels, sequels, remakes, reboots, and cookie-cutter superhero movies."
"You can&#39;t swing a stick without banging it into yet another superhero movie. About 14 years ago, I decided I would demand originality. No more would I pay to go see a prequel, sequel, remake, reboot or superhero movie. That means that some weeks only one movie qualifies, and some weeks none do. But my sanity has been saved.  I asked an independent filmmaker why it is that Hollywood keeps cranking out franchises only and are not interested in anything original. He said , &quot;Follow the money. A Studio is investing a few hundred million in a movie, that property has to have some recognition by the public. They&#39;re more interested in their profit line than in entertaining.  Thus, you get sequels and such, nothing original, nothing new, and utterly predictable. It&#39;s so bad, the only way they can HOPE to keep your attention is by having explosions every 44 seconds.  That may satisfy the X-box crowd, but not your general moviegoer."
Go Woke Go Broke‚Ä¶
I dont want to watch it. The first one resonated with me more than any other movie at the time. I was going through a divorce and addiction when it came out and i was so gone. But that hit home. Thats exactly how i felt. And it was great
"Maybe James Cameron should have done the Joker 2, he&#39;s good at sequels"
"Ha, it‚Äôs amusing how Walsh has become a film connoisseur since he produced two of his own‚Ä¶"
Empire strikes back.
"Simple answer Todd Phillips hate comic books, he said it himself"
Madness for two. It actually a real psychological disorder in which two unrelated people share the same disorder and symptoms
Saw this previews when I went to watch Matt Walsh‚Äôs movie. Knew I wouldn‚Äôt be seeing that sick movie.
"Ive heard it sucked bad. Ill watch the 1st one again instead,  save me from wasting my time on this one."
Lady Gaga as the &quot;love interest&quot;.<br>Big mistake from the jump.<br>She looks and acts like your crackhead cousin nobody in the family talks about.
"Aliens, Terminator 2, Wrath of Kahn, and Empire Strikes Back were not planned and arguably are better than the first movies."
So sorry for Joaqu√≠n to be put in the position of acting alongside such a mediocre person as Germanotta. She‚Äôs the reason it flopped; everything this fake actress wannabe touches turns to üí©.
"I think Dark Knight is an exception to that sequel rule. I&#39;m pretty sure Christopher Nolan said it himself that he intentionally didn&#39;t want to think about a sequel. And it was his first time directing a major motion picture, so I understand why he wouldn&#39;t want to think that far down the line before nailing the first movie."
I actually hated the first one. Just couldn‚Äôt take all the glorified killing and turned it off.
Joaquin is a hair lipped reminder of what could have been.
Art is dead. Postmodernism killed it.
I didn&#39;t even know they made a sequel until today. Definitely not interested
shrek 2 is the good sequel
"I really liked the movie. And I think there was a lot to read in it, especially in the musical scenes and the courtroom scenes that people keep saying add nothing, I didn&#39;t think that at all, it&#39;s just you need to read the situation of the moments closer.<br><br>Now of course the first Joker had a rawness to it, and very dynamic with lots of things happening and interesting locations, and had a very emotional and ironic ending where Arthur finds the notoriety he wanted but only in completely losing himself. It was a really good movie... but had it&#39;s silly moments too, it wasn&#39;t a perfect movie. Neither was this sequel, especially since it&#39;s minimal location settings didn&#39;t make it feel like a bigger movie, which sequels usually are supposed to be. But I think the sequel&#39;s depiction of society on entertainment and media figures is so spot on: it&#39;s too much if you make it your entire identity, or combine it to be a political expression.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the film is a direct criticism to fans of the first film. That&#39;s too easy. It&#39;s definitely about how people want media figures in general to conform to what they desire, and you see that being done by multiple characters towards Arthur in the sequel. And Arthur is so desperate for attention that he&#39;ll do what he&#39;s told, but the moment he truly finds freedom, and that&#39;s in recognizing his wrongs and owning up to his faults, he loses the hearts of everyone who aren&#39;t willing to do the same. So they&#39;ll follow the next bloke who takes Arthur&#39;s place, because that&#39;s what happens: someone crazier on the internet does something silly and now they&#39;re the flavour of the month because they&#39;ll do what others wouldn&#39;t. The movie is a lot more thoughtful than what people take it for. It&#39;s not as whimsical for a musical ON PURPOSE, it&#39;s not romantic with Harley Quinn ON PURPOSE. I think it&#39;s decisions were thought out well and not a failed attempt at anything.<br><br>....... And the soundtrack is awesome."
Robocop 2
I have ZERO interest in modern movies
Joker 2 is a movie made about how dumb and evil fans of the first film are.
They don&#39;t care if it&#39;s a flop. It&#39;s worth it to undo everything the first movie represented and did. It was made out of spite towards the first movie&#39;s audience.
Terminator 2.  Temple of doom.  Empire strikes back. Etc.
"Half that for marketing, not double"
Joker 1 and 2 are really fine emblems of the degeneration of the film industry.
"Go woke go broke, haha suck it hollywood."
The director was mad because the wrong people enjoyed the first movie. So he made sure no one would like the sequel.
"exception.  The Road Warrior, the second Mad Max film.  Mad Max was never meant to be a &quot;universe&quot;.   Joker 2 sucked either way, and I loved the first one."
We need more Matt movie reviews
I‚Äôm very glad it‚Äôs failing so hard. Stop making shitty sequels
"They did this on purpose just to destroy the name, they were pissed off at the success of Joker."
The Empire Strikes Back? It was the best sequel.
Empire Strikes Back
Gaga is a talentless puff of vaporü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è she‚Äôs just un likable
Jaws 2
Terminator 2
Lazy writing and and lack of creativity has killed entertainment
JOKER 2 FAILURE hhhhhhhhhhaaaaa
Lady Gaga is a death sentence.
I didn&#39;t think anyone still went to the movies
"Aliens, Indiana Jones Last Crusade, Terminator 2‚Ä¶ all excellent unplanned sequels."
the exception to the rule is Aliens. Alien was a hit and they said hey! lets make another. good thing james cameron was there to make it.
I wish Matt would do his show with the man bun and sport jacket.
119 what excuses moi
"Caesar Remaro is the only Joker, Phoenix dude is weird. Also Havre Bardem, not a fan of either"
How could a musical not be a big hit?
"Batman is so over-done, Joker as well, Make something new!"
I didn‚Äôt like the first one either. I can‚Äôt stand  Joaquin Phoenix.  Ever  since he  pretended to have mental illness for an entire year and then said ‚Äújust kidding‚Äù I can hardly stand to see his face.
As soon as you said Lady Gaga üôÑ I was in total agreement with you about the movie sucking she is a total joke
"I barely like the first joker movie ( I know I‚Äôm in the minority here ) then they made the second one into a musical, I‚Äôm not a fan of musicals ."
Lot of great nonplanned/original sequels but I do agree most are soulless cash grabs.
Legit the first Matt Walsh anything I ever watched‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre insight may be correct sir and my day is ruined. I wanted this to be good so bad.
Joker 2: Fully a Dud
Joker 2: Fully a Doo
I wouldn‚Äôt even watch that drivel for free
"&quot;Godfather, Part II&quot; is AT LEAST as great a story as, The Godfather.&quot;"
T2 bruh
‚Äúcultural penetration‚Äù
Even if it‚Äôs a great movie I still would pay to see it. I loathe Gaga and most actors today. Hollywood corrupts minds. Boycott Hollywood garbage
"If they were trying to make the joker franchise a joke, they succeeded"
Joker...drops a deuce.
"Both Joker films are brilliant. The ‚Äúfanboys‚Äù don‚Äôt get and I guess you, might be a blind one too. Not seeing the brilliance of this masterful sequel proves, to me, that you may not be a total brilliant commentator after all. Like you I‚Äôm a conservative and I‚Äôve enjoyed you up to this point. A disagreement regarding Todd Phillips breakthrough film. Hollywood needs dramas on this scale than whatever you think passes for cinema in these times. For me it goes beyond what is expected from the house nerds and maybe you. Todd Phillips, like Kubrick and all the pre 1980s new wave directors get it. You unfortunately don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs sad because I have immense appreciation of your droll humor against the current liberal Hollywood products and current liberal media machines. I will go see your film tomorrow and I faithfully hope to enjoy it. And I‚Äôm sure I will. But you are completely wrong about this film."
"Sequels capitalizing from success that were not  planned from the beginning and have no real continuation to the plot of the first story: 1) All the Jurassic movies 2) All the Toy Story Movies 3) The Frozen movies 4) The Alien movies 5) Finding Dory 6) Inside Out 7) Beetlejuice.... I mean, could go on but..."
"Yo Matt Walsh, your editor hates you with these shitty thumbnails"
Aliens 2...much better than the first. Making an edit...Terminator 2 (as seen below) was also awesome.
Terminator 2 is my sequel favorite!
Lol I knew it and I haven‚Äôt even watched it. They blew it by adding an insane woman with   him ü§£
"I can hardly wait for Matt‚Äôs comments about ‚ÄúConclave.‚Äù üòë Still feeling battered by the Olympics in Paris, I have no plans to see ‚ÄúConclave.‚Äù Instead, I might watch ‚ÄúTwo Popes‚Äù for the third time. At least it was intellectually stimulating and also respectful."
Top gun Maverick
"Why is everyone missing the elephant in the room????? Why ONLY made this as a cash grab after the success of the first one... BUT they made THIS! A movie sure to lose money!!!!!!!! It makes ZERO sense, even if they made this to spite the audience, they did it just to lose money?????? It&#39;s bizarre."
All Walsh thumbnails have him looking like he&#39;s stoned and thinking about what he wants to eat
This was hard to sit through. I knew it was a ‚Äòmusical‚Äô but geez. Couldn‚Äôt stop looking at my watch.
"Aliens 2, The Dark Knight, Terminator 2, Top Gun Maverick‚Ä¶ there are many successful sequels.. but most often they fail miserably!"
Terminator 2 and Alien 2 [Aliens] I believe those were two unplanned sequels.
All the star trek movies are Rubbish üò≥üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø
Home alone 2 might be better than the first‚Ä¶.thats it
Some useless bean counter actually thought Gaga would be a better Quinn than Margot Robbie. Seriously.
The best review I heard that shared everyone&#39;s sentiment was: &quot;I&#39;m tired of Harley Quinn now.&quot;
My perspective is don&#39;t ever see the first movie so you won&#39;t be disappointed by the sequel.
"Wrecking your career to make a FU movie towards the people that helped build your career by buying your product makes about as much sense and is as effective as the idiots smashing up their Harley Davidsons  because the company went ‚Äúwoke‚Äù.  <br><br>It‚Äôs self immolation and stupidity that doesn‚Äôt affect the target of your rage one bit,  they already got what they wanted."
Neither your review nor opinion matter an iota. What matters is box office. And by that measure it&#39;s a massive flop. It&#39;s not complicated. It&#39;s basic economics.
Rocky 2 is an exception that has been considered better than the 1st to some or many but yes usually the sequel is not as good
"2 sequels that I think of that were great that weren&#39;t planned are Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Those, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re planned, but they are just incredible!"
Joker 2: Totally Boo
Ahh you must have never seen hot tub Time Machine. 2
üëã honest question‚Ä¶. Does Lady Ga Ga have yonder lady bits or man flaps?
All of the Joker movies are trash. The guy is an idiot. The whole storyline is ridiculous. They need to give up these damn superheroes and super villains. They need to start making decent films and not CGI crash scenes. I knew it would be a trash film just because it had lady gag gag in it. She is Queen trailer trash. I wouldn&#39;t watch this movie if I was payed.
Wow what a shocker when the first one with JP was horrible...
Actually‚Ä¶Weekend at Bernie‚Äôs 2 was an unplanned sequel that topped the performance of the original movie which was an unexpected hit‚Ä¶
We need ‚Äúwhat is a women‚Ä¶.folie deux‚Äù
The other joker sucked
"Top Gun: Maverick was great, don&#39;t think it was planned at the time. But generally speaking I agree that those types of sequels do stink."
A few hours after I eat Taco Bell is never a good sequel.
I think you&#39;re the first person to distinguish between planned sequels versus unplanned sequels in terms of quality!
The only unplanned sequel movie I‚Äôll vouch for is Shrek 2
hollywood is very jewish
"Not calling it art or a master piece, but Terminator 2 was a better version of the original.  The machine learns to be human and becomes a father John Conner didn&#39;t have.  Good for a sequel."
"I paid 39 dollars for two tickets, large popcorn 1 soda to see Matt&#39;s Am I racist movie. I wanted to pay that money. I could have not and waited, but I did, but with Joker 2. I will evoke my White Privilege and yes that means I will get to see Joker 2 for free, with movie quality popcorn. I&#39;ll show up at the theater, flash my White Card with premium membership privileges and score the free eats and tickets. The real question is will I spend 2 hours of my life seeing it? On the plus side I do earn points on my white privilege membership card, but I also saw Beetlejuice, not like I need the points right now"
Joker 2: Folie-a-don&#39;t.
"There‚Äôs a new Joker? <br>I really didn‚Äôt know that. I guess I must be cooler than Walsh.<br>You know, Walsh doesn‚Äôt strike me as a guy that would give crap about reviewing a movie. Gotta get those views though."
"It&#39;s a musical, not a movie."
"1b - 40m is not more than double, more than 20x"
WATCH TERRIFIER 3 üòÅ
"Lady Gaga can‚Äôt act.  Put bad actors in a movie, it‚Äôs gonna stink."
This sucks! I was looking forward to seeing Joker 2 for months and then I come to find out it was garbage?
"Alien -&gt; Aliens = a sequel that matches and/or exceeds success of the original. Of course, this was done by bringing on a new director with a new vision, and shifting genres. However Folly a Deux was a shift in genre too, just an uninspired one."
I don&#39;t think terminator 2 was planned
The first one was enough.  There was no demand for this film.
More like ‚ÄúFolly part Deux‚Äù
So who needs or asked for a musical Joker? I would think that the character&#39;s native eccentricities are rich enough material for any number of non-musical films...
I remember Matt Walsh raving about A Quiet Place 2 being even better than the first
"The Joker was an excellent movie, but the liberal woke critics hated it because it was sympathetic to young males who weren&#39;t integrated into wokeness, but had problems enough of their own. So I suppose the sequel is an ass-kissing attempt to get back in the critics&#39; woke graces -- but I&#39;ll never know for sure, because I&#39;ll never see the sequel."
Everybody didn&#39;t want to make it. They offered so much money nobody could say no.<br>So they took the lead from Matrix Resurrections and did the exact same thing.
"Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have invented or made."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=167"">2:47</a> &quot;Sequels that were not planned [...] are terrible in literally ever case.&quot;  False Matt, false!  <b><i>Aliens</i></b> (1986) is the sequel to <b><i>Alien</i></b> (1979) and it&#39;s better in every way. I am prepared to die on this hill."
It was terrible
"This joker 2 sequel seems like it could have been a no brainer, picking up where it left off in the original.  Arthur Fleck continues down his path of madness and his war against society until he fully becomes the joker.  It could have been a home run but instead, they make some lazy musical that pisses every one off.  Why did Phoenix even agree to do this?"
Geez you are boring. Like yeah I get it but now you&#39;re a film critic?
Joker 2 was a success if they&#39;re trying to ruin movies and I feel like they are.
"Matt, if there is any talent/intelligence remaining in the entertainment industry it must come forward Now - otherwise the online world will rise to the future."
Thank you for saving me money and 2 hours. This movie sounds like hot garbage.
"This movie was made for people who hated the first one, who were never going to see the sequel anyways"
Mad Max 2 Road Warrior‚Ä¶classic
"It&#39;s a conspiracy, and I mean that in all seriousness, believe it or not. They have to make every white hero , anti hero , or cool villain that white men resonate with either gay or weak. It&#39;s not by accident and it&#39;s not a coincidence. White military age men are the biggest threat so Hollywood has been trying to castrate them in entertainment. Soy is being pushed to us. Only group with a gag order on social media. Joker 2 is just one little part of this game plan. With that said look at me and tell me it&#39;s all just a weird coincidence and I&#39;ll look at you like the idiot that you are."
The first one sucked... This one must be total garbage
Richard III was a sequel to Shakespeare&#39;s Henry VI trilogy.
I get the distinct feeling that Hollywood film makers are more interested in their message than they are in film.
I Watched The New Joker And Here‚Äôs My Honest Review - You have my sympathies.Thankful I had no idea it was coming out. üòÇ
"Not to be snarky, but three sequels that were arguably better or of the same quality as the original movie: aliens, road warrior, second terminator movie."
The exception to the rule is blade runner 2049
So every single second of the movie sucked? Really? I find that hard to believe. Even crappy movies have a moment or two that are good.
Lol. They made it a musical...
Ah man did  it sucked lol.hour n half my life ill never get back!
"My son and I saw the movie last Sunday.  I don&#39;t like DEI and Wokeness, and I&#39;m not a big fan of DC Comics.  Every YT channel addressing this movie is trashing it.  I get it.  My son didn&#39;t like it.  Understand.  I didn&#39;t love the movie, but I thought it was worth seeing.  Not a fan of Lady Gaga, but between her singing and Joaquin&#39;s efforts, they told a story.  Yeah, maybe it didn&#39;t align with the 2019 characters.  You can down-vote me all you want; I&#39;ll wear those as badges of honor.  Open your minds.  Explore the space."
"The first one was not original either, rather a virtual remake of Taxi Driver and Kings of Comedy a Scorsese movie mashup this one was hilariously changed into a musical which alienated the core audience intentionally. <br><br>You should have gone to the new Matt Walsh movie instead"
My theory is that Joaquin Phoenix unintentionally sabotaged Phillips&#39; vision for the first Joker. And the result was a far better movie than the one Phillips was trying to make. Phoenix does have that level of talent. And what was Phillips supposed to do? Complain about it? He clearly was trying to repudiate his own movie with the second one.<br><br>There just appears to be a lot of people in Hollywood who are far more enamored with themselves than they ought to be. I suppose success in that sort of industry could tend to cause such an attitude.
"Thanks for taking the hit, Matt. Hollywood is evil. I wasn&#39;t going to see it but my wife was hinting she wanted to so this definitely helps my cause. Appreciate it üôè"
Probably the greatest example of a sequel that wasnt planned that exceeded the first movie comes from non other than star wars empire strikes back. Better in every way. But i admit they are rare
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=210"">3:30</a> &quot;A Distant Thunder&quot; by Mark IV films is vastly superior to &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot;"
"I was excited to hear that they were doing a sequel.  Once I heard it was a musical, I was out."
Can‚Äôt stand her ü§¢ü§¢ right there it‚Äôs going to tank.
"I won&#39;t watch it just cause whatever her face is harley. Wow, after hearing the movie plot that is terrible, they couldnt come up with something better than that? Pathetic."
It&#39;s not that bad. It&#39;s too clever. A giant middle finger to the Hollywood machine. Good for Phoebix and Philips. üëç
"I havent seen it yet, probably wont, but i dont mind the ending, it nods to me that joker is an archetype not a person and that makes him that much more terrifying. I don&#39;t think it is aimed at those who loved the first film, but that joker can exist anywhere, any time, any place, and this fits with joker as a psychological archetype of pure chaos. And that if society abandons people they manufacture jokers - I like it :)"
"Not a movie, but Street Fighter 2 was better than Street Fighter 1. :)"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=183"">3:03</a> Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=166"">2:46</a> I can think of at least 2: Aliens, Terminator 2"
"The only way for this movie to do good was to make the Joker more crazy, which you would think could be a possibility with injecting Harley Quinn in the film,  pushing the Joker to go deeper into his Joker personality. They could have let the Joker embrace his role, escape with the help of Harley Quinn, killing a few people along the way and disappear into the night as they cause chaos, thus setting it up for a third movie where they could bring in the new Batman to make a crazy third-movie climax. <br><br>But, no. Nothing happened. They had the Joker rejecting his crazy Joker personality. It led nowhere. Just some songs. So anticlimactic and boring. The irony is that in the movie even Harley Quinn was pissed off that nothing happened and that he fell in love and did not want to be the Joker anymore."
Matt should direct the next Marvel movie.
Have not been to the movies in 25 years. No TV or cable in 10 years. Seen a &#39;&#39;commercial&#39;&#39; at a store and it was nauseating .
"&quot;Clerks&quot; was such a great movie, that I have never watched the sequel exactly for this reason."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> Aliens is an exception to the rule."
"I think it was a hit piece designed to üí© on fans for liking Joker. I&#39;ve been saying this about a lot of movies, (including The Crow remake) but  m a r x i s m  seeks to make all art ugly, boring, drab, etc. to extinguish the spirit. If good things happen, it&#39;s by accident."
"Both Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2 are examples of sequels that were better than the first. Just saying, it happens."
DONT TRUST ACTORS TO TAKE OVER THE PRODUCERS JOB. ü§° that‚Äôs on the director and higher ups for listening to Gaga. She should have been fired the MOMENT she started complaining about the script.
"Im still boycott Hollywood due to Will Smith incident....never did watch the Grammys much after the 90s ..but after his little stunt any purchase for a movie ticket will be heavily scrutinized.   it&#39;s eventually going to be available streaming within 2 weeks depending on the review..I spent money on a pretty good home theater system as well.   So if I want that true movie theater experience, it&#39;s most likely going to be a high impact film that warrants it"
original was bad. so i am glad.
I‚Äôm convinced marvel ruined hollywood
I think the sequel that on paper never should have happened but surprised everyone in its excellence was Bladerunner 2049
creative people are not creative anymore.
"Unplanned sequels that were excellent. <br>1) Terminator 2: Judgement Day<br>2) Aliens (Sequel to Alien)<br>3) Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. The whole numbering thing was not part of the plan with the 77 release of Star Wars, and the original theatrical release does not say Episode 4; that was added later. If you don&#39;t believe me, you have to admit they did not have the plot of Empire in mind when they wrote Star Wars.  <br>4) Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan<br>5) Arguably The Dark Knight. While the Joker&#39;s card is left at the end of Batman Begins, Nolan expected Batman Begins to be a standalone film. That said, he was open to the possibility of a sequel, and hinted at it, but it was not planned when Batman Begins was filmed. <br>6) Far into the Franchise, New Nightmare for Nightmare on Elm Street. <br>7) The Road Warrior, a sequel so good many think it was the first film even though the first film was a small-budget picture called Mad Max.<br>8) Godfather II, which despite Matt&#39;s comments was not planned at the time Godfather was written though it was based on unused parts of the novel<br>9) Evil Dead II<br>10) The Bourne Supremacy<br>11) Lethal Weapon II<br>12) Rambo: First Blood Part II<br>13) Addams Family Values<br>14) The Devil&#39;s Rejects [Added Note: Sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, which I do not recommend]<br>15) Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade<br>16) Superman II [Added per comment below though it was filmed in parallel with Superman I. That said, it was significantly reshot and the directors were changed. One could object to this one].<br>17) X2: X-Men United has a higher Rotten Tomatoes score than the original.<br>18) Star Trek: First Contact (The sequel to Star Trek: Generations, the first TNG Star Trek film)<br>19) Spider-Man 2 (Higher RT score than the first Spider-Man)<br>20) Dawn of the Dead (Slightly higher audience score than Night of the Living Dead)<br>21) Logan (acclaimed sequel to the lacklustre Wolverine)<br><br><br>You might not agree with my whole list. I expect some of you to argue about whether a few of them were planned, but many were clearly not. <br><br>Clearly, there are enough examples there to prove that it does happen.<br><br>[A sequel is any film that comes after the original in continuity. So a Part III is still a sequel. Last Crusade is thus a sequel in that it is the third instalment and the first film to come after Raiders. Temple of Doom is, in fact, a prequel. Merriam webster defines it as &quot;A book, film, play, etc. that continues the story of an earlier one.&quot; So a later part is still a sequel, not just the second one. This is evidenced by people referring to a franchise&#39;s sequels in plural. &quot;I like Saw but did not like the sequels.&quot;]"
&quot;fully a deuce&quot;
"Remember that the left did not like the first one because the Joker started out this poor, marginalized soul trying to make it through a cruel world.     The movie made us all feel guilty. You see, the left wants you to believe that evil is some metaphysical thing that has always been there, like the Devil or Pennywise.  Well, look at how they fixed it. They flipped the script.  Taking the evil away from poor Fleck and putting it on this unknown crazy out of nowhere.  Same principle with King hating Kubrick&#39;s Shining.  King&#39;s version was supernatural.  Kubrick&#39;s was ambiguous but heavily leaned on the psychological instead of the mystical.   Jack was an abuser.  No ghost.  King is a leftist who thinks evil is something out there, lurching to possess us.  King, like the left, does not want to take the responsibility that it is we who create and perpetuate evil.  It is man-made and not metaphysically given."
Army of Darkness is a rare trilogy improvement of the original lol
"I&#39;m not a fan of Lady Gaga, but I disagree that she&#39;s not a good actor. Maybe her performance isn&#39;t good in this movie. But I thought she was good in A Star is Born"
The people that made this movie give zero Fs about how well it does. It was made as an F U to regular people that loved the first one. They hit the genie in a bottle with the first one as an art piece that actually worked and hate that fact.
Well at least it made more monet than Borderlands
Money Laundering? A musical movie with no original songs?
Road Warrior<br>The Dark Knight<br>Spider Man 2<br>X-Men 2<br>Empire Strikes Back<br>Shrek 2<br>Terminator 2<br>Aliens<br>Godfather 2
There‚Äôs a movie about the joker!?   üòÇ
There were plenty of story hooks from the first movie to pursue. It&#39;s an accomplishment to eff up this bad.
It should be renamed to Joker: Forcer √° caca üí© Finest dump in all of France üá´üá∑
"Terminator 2, Mad Max 2, Aliens 2"
I feel fortunate that I live in such a media vacuum that I didn&#39;t even know that this movie existed until today. Thanks for letting me know it&#39;s worthless.
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is an exception.
Why this movie failed it‚Äôs not that nobody didn‚Äôt want a sequel. It‚Äôs because once you announce you‚Äôre making it a musical and you‚Äôre making what the first one was a joke. Nobody wants to see that you‚Äôre hurting a certain type of audience with this kind of movie and now you‚Äôre trying to go get another audience that‚Äôs not interested in this kind of movie And that‚Äôs why it fails. So now you alienated the people that would‚Äôve wanted to go see it and the people who would want to go see it or not taking the people that would go with them to go see it in there in a since you have floo
Gremlins 2
Does this really surprise anyone? Hollywood is dead. Wokeness has killed it.
"I enjoyed Joker2, even though I&#39;m not into musicals.<br>We all have unrealistic expectations. <br>Arthurs life was pitiful but he always had hope. Eventually even that was stripped from him and he died pitifully.<br>&quot; all hope abandon ye who enter here&quot;"
Tim dillon has the funniest take ever üòÇ
Terminator 2
"They made Joker immortal in the comics, so that&#39;s the point where the character went off the rails AFAIC.<br><br>The movie... I haven&#39;t seen the first one so I&#39;m not going to jump to judging the second one."
Probably Aliens and Terminator 2 are  the only  afterthought sequel that are  as good if not better than the first
How many original new films could that budget have funded?.
"its a musical not a movie, i left before halfway in it"
Does your cup say leftist tears? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I think a lot of your analysis is good but how on earth do you not remember the ultimate, great, unplanned, cash grab sequel: Aliens. <br><br>And, to a lesser degree, terminator 2. <br><br>And Star Trek 2 wasn‚Äôt exactly planned ahead of time, either."
"People are tired of The Joker. Rehashed too much.<br><br> Airplane II, now that was a great sequel :)"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=139"">2:19</a> The Godfather Part II came after the success of the first one. It was never planned from the start"
Terminator 2 was a very good sequel.
"Stat Trek 2:Wrath of Kahn<br>Silence of the Lambs<br>Empire Strikes Back<br>House 2<br>Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2<br>Terminator 2<br>Aliens<br>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior <br>Bill &amp; Ted‚Äôs Bogus Journey <br>Austin Powers and the Spy who shagged me<br>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(Temple of Doom wasn‚Äôt as good as Raiders, but in the timeline, Temple is technically a Prequel &amp; the Last Crusade is the sequel)<br>Spider-Man 2 (Toby McGuire)<br>Dollars Trilogy<br>Chronicles of Riddick (just kidding)<br><br>Were all good sequels, that went a somewhat different direction than the original and were arguably better than their originals."
"Didn&#39;t watch Matt&#39;s review because I negative interest in seeing the movie.  But, comment for the algo"
The first one is enough. Didn&#39;t need another one.
"I like your movies, and ideas on some stuff.  I think JRE kind of embarassed you on ghey marriage.  With that being said, the last thing I care about is Matt&#39;s opinion on new movies, or even any movies from 1970 till Today."
"The exception to that rule is Star Wars. After its unexpected success, the sequel Empire Strikes Back went on to become widely regarded as the best movie in the entire franchise (let alone the original trilogy)"
So Homeboy makes a good film or two and suddenly (over years) he has deep insight into story telling? Yup.
"Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan was an unplanned sequel that not only beat the crap out of the first movie, but was a great moxie in its own right. Not merely the best Trek movie, but an excellent movie."
"You done messed up. Just watch @Critical Drinker, @Filmthreat and @Nerdrotic. Will save you the pain of watching trash."
It was a beautifully shot and well acted movie. It was just boring.
Why is the phoenix walking instead of flying?
"I never thought about it that way before, but you are right, Matt.  Most movies we love are traditional good vs evil movies (Star Wars), make a hero, or movies where two people find each other.  Somehow Hollywood despite itself makes a traditional old fashioned movie everyone loves.  Then when it makes a sequel, it UNMAKES it.  It writes in a divorce, makes the good character really evil.  They did this with National Treasure, Star Wars, Indiana Jones - they actually do it with all of them.  In essence, they are saying to the audience, you were stupid for falling in love with these characters and this story - so let&#39;s destroy them for you."
"joker ,  the first movie was such a strong tragedy well written ....Best tradegy on screen to date in my mind .. Harley Quin is spose to bne a  drop dead georgeous Psych and we got Laddy Gar Gar ......  Well she was drawn like that whn i first saw her i the comics as far as comic stips go ...Rreality is most peopel are good , self cernteerd and entiled probabaly but still nice people .. Holywood on the other hand tries to keep ramming  their hypocritical Ideology as they sit behind cloed gates estates getting their servants to do EVERYTHING for them pontificateing to us about how us mortals should live thenthey go back to their gated communities where every one can  be nice cauise they have the staff to be nice for them .... Hypocracy used to be the worst traight in a civilised society now it seems , as i see it Hypocracy is the norm ..."
Home Alone 2!
It had a 37.8 million opening.
Got a better sequel for you.  Equalizer 2 was better than first.  Denzel&#39;s first sequel so not planned in advance. (He had a policy against sequels prior)
Maybe studying the market to see how avertising affects a bad product?
Hollywood hates us and the Joker 2 movie was a FU from Hollywood to the movie watchers. Hollywood is dead. Their all rats on a ship. Their secrets are all about to be revealed.
Bride of Frankenstein (1935) is the exception to your rule. Not planned in advance and not only exceeds the original but has my vote for greatest horror film of all time.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=187"">3:07</a>   Aliens and Terminator 2 would be examples of exceptions.  They‚Äôre rare but they exist."

"Aliens, T-2, Predator 2 (yes, it&#39;s bloody good).  Road Warrior."
"That‚Äôs pretty interesting Matt except there‚Äôs one little problem<br><br><br><br>NOTHING YOU HAVE SAID IS ANYTHING NEW! You pretend like you are the first person to come to the realisation that Hollywood <b>GASP</b> prefers money over making art?! Oh the humanity?! You are not the first person to point it out nor will you be the last. Plus shouldn‚Äôt the mantra of sequels be that ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt as good as the original.‚Äù And not ‚Äúall sequels suck.‚Äù<br><br>Plus there are films that were clearly planned to have sequels but have bombed so bad that they have to cancel any future sequels. The reason why most popular films are based on an existing IP because you will guarantee to get a reaction out of people whether it be good or bad. Take the minecraft movie trailer, the fact that it‚Äôs live action and jack black is playing Steve has gotten a big reaction out of people so they spread the word about the trailer. Do you know what we call that? Free advertisement. With the ever rising popularity of fandoms online, people would most likely go watch something that they are familiar with and can have an open ending discussion with rather than something that they‚Äôre not familiar with. Does it suck that we don‚Äôt have more original properties be more talked about than the ones based off of something? Yes absolutely but that‚Äôs just how it is and as long people react to it they will keep doing it.<br><br><br>But what annoys me so much about this video is that why does Matt Walsh care if joker 2 sucks? He has stated pretty clearly that he does not think highly of superhero films at all and he even says that everyone who is an adult who like superhero movies are a obsessed man baby who lives under their parents basement, so why the hell does he give a shit about this movie. At least everyone else who has been shitting on this movie do it because they care about the first movie, DC and the joker character himself because the clown prince of crime deserves better than this. If Matt didn‚Äôt say anything about joker 2 than nothing would be loss but at the same time his red pill addicted fans will believe and agree with anything that comes out of this guy‚Äôs mouth, he could say shit like ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay to beat up your wife if she talks back to you.‚Äù Or ‚Äúbabies are totally capable of using a gun.‚Äù And they will eat that shit up.<br><br>And that‚Äôs why Matt wash‚Äôs opinions on pop culture are today CANCELED."
Joker 2: Fully Adieu
"Hollywood and the Elites think it&#39;s their duty to be the Shepherds of Society. Instead of telling stories to entertain us they are now telling us how to live our lives though their stories as if it&#39;s their right. In other words a group of people that make things up has joined with a group people that lie for a living and they think they know how WE should live, I don&#39;t think so."
Joker 2: The search for more money
Saturated market when you already have MSM and TV
Apparently he‚Äôs never seen home alone 2!
Karate Kid 2 wasn‚Äôt planned. And it did better than Karate Kid 1.
What can you expect from a director that kept milking The Hangover movie.
"DARK KNIGHT<br>checkmate, Matt. That was not planned when Batman Begins was made."
I think Both Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix wanted this movie to bomb and planned it as soon as it was greenlighted.  Making it a musical is my evidence.  Joaquin Phoenix not doing sequels and then agreeing to do this also points to it.
Gaga is pure repulsion incarnate.
&quot;It failed artistically&quot; such a funny statement from you when you obviously didn&#39;t even understand the artistic intent behind this or even the first movie.
‚Ä¶and joker is now a bisexual. Nice üòÇ
"I get the greed behind a sequel, but, as usual it is just a cash grab, to make rich people feel guilty."
Halloween 2 and Transporter 2 were better than the originals. There&#39;s also an argument for Die Hard 2.
2 issues why it flopped.  1 - they made it a musical.  2 - Lady Gaga‚Ä¶nuff said.
"Forgot to mention no competition, No big releases"
"Joaquin phoenix A / Lady GaGa B  / Brendan Gleeson A  / the rest of the cast B-  / The sets A-/ the editing and directing A- / the script F the musical number killed any momentum the movie had. The total deconstruction of Aurther Fleck was an abomination. totally ruining the ending of the first movie, which left us wondering if the whole thing was just in Jokers mind or was it all real? OH YEAH WTH WAS JOKER??? over all the movie was a failure."
This movie is an attack on fans of the first movie.<br>Its very good it failed.
"There are plenty of amazing sequels that weren&#39;t planned from the start: Aliens, Predator 2, The Road Warrior, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, RoboCop 2, Terminator 2, Dawn of the Dead, Silence of the Lambs, Mallrats... however, all those came from filmmakers of a different time, people with vision and artitistic integrity.  Allmost all time nonsence nowadays is coming from studio boards and IP farms."
"While Matt is correct that unplanned sequels are generally terrible, there are a few exceptions. The Dark Knight, Toy Story 2, Terminator 2, Aliens, Mission Impossible 2, Rocky 2, and Top Gun Maverick come to mind."
Sounds like Joe Dirt 2

"I haven&#39;t gone to the cinema for over eleven years, and I have no intention of ever going again."
"director did this on purpose.  he hated that his first movie&#39;s story and depiction of the main character has been coopted and lovingly memed by the Right.   he thought he would cause great amounts of pain and discomfort in the Right by destroying what he had created and by emasculating and killing off his character in the sequel.  instead, we are laughing and celebrating the economic and reputational losses suffered by the director and woke hollywood."
"Terminator 2. Aliens. When you have talent, you can make a sequel."
I watched it and it was entertaining. It has major flaws but I&#39;d rather have watched the film than watch sports.
Unnecessary sequels...<br><b>Alamo 2 Remember This</b> <br><b>Joker drops a deuce</b> üòÖ
People don‚Äôt hate it because it‚Äôs leaning to 1 side politically. People don‚Äôt hate it because it‚Äôs pushing an agenda they disagree with. People don‚Äôt hate it because it‚Äôs snotty pretentious art house made for critics. It‚Äôs just a straight up bad movie that audiences on both sides of the political isle as well as critics agree is terrible. I am convinced the sequel only exists to diminish the specialness of the first movie.
Robert De Niro was in the movie as well. But all his scenes were cut.
I heard it&#39;s basically a musical. Very disappointing because I ain&#39;t gay so I can&#39;t see it
Why do we care what this guy thinks about movies? How dumb
I&#39;m gonna stop you right there. Two towers was NOT better then Fellowship of the Ring.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze. Greatest sequel ever made.
The first one was bad so I wouldn&#39;t imagine that this one would be any better.
It‚Äôs pretty bad when everyone can collectively agree that this movie was terrible.
Aliens was a sequel that matched the original and wasn‚Äôt planned.
Why would they put lady gagyou in a movie ?
Gaga is not an actor and it showed she was a flop
Manly GaGa was an automatic lead weight.
I thought the first one was bad
GaGa should stick to wearing meat dresses and leave acting to the professionals.
I really enjoyed the movie üé¨
I dug it
I love that the cut Robert DeNiro out of it
üòÇ
"Its going to get smacked down by Terrifier 3.  Art the Clown closer resembles the Joker character, than Arthur Fleck."
I was at least interested enough to watch the sequel until I heard it was a musical and I immediately knew that was the wrong genre for this type of film. I have absolutely no interest in seeing it now.
"Star Trek the Wrath of khan,was a really good sequel."
I would say Terminator 2 and both the sequels to Captain America were better and more successful than the originals.
All thanks to Michael Moore. Philips wasn&#39;t going to make a sequel until Moore urged him to. Listen to Moore&#39;s interview with Philips on Moore&#39;s podcast a few years ago. Joker should have been a standalone masterpiece.
Im not seeing any movie with Lady demon
Worst movie I have ever seen no action at all
My friend says Joker 3 is in the works.
Beetlejuice 2 was better than the first movie. Joker 2 is now on my top 5 worst movies watched.
"The thing that makes me happy,is the amount of people NOT going to crappy movies just because of big names in the movies.<br>I can&#39;t explain Barbie though.<br>Margot Robbie is expected to make 70 million dollars on the back end.<br>Maybe it was her back end that got people to see Barbie.üòÇ"
Empire Strikes Back
"Aliens, Terminator 2, Toy Story 2, Top Gun Maverick. All excellent sequels not envisaged during the writing / production of their respective prequels."
Watched it twice 4 fr and ill say this. The script had good and bad points but the ending sucked

How much money must you have to make a 300 million dollar loss write off
"Thank you Matt. The 1st Joker sucked so i will save all time related to Joker 2, including you saying how much it sucks"
Terminator 2 and Aliens were better than the originals.
Does this mean that they aren&#39;t going to make &quot;Joker : Menage a Trois&quot;   ?
Nobody cares what your favorite sequel is people get over yourself!
Total cultural penetration. Gigitty
Once I heard about the &quot;musical &amp; courtroom drama&quot; angle I was automatically out!
Best sequel gotta be Shawshank Reloaded.

It&#39;s terrible and destroys the first film.
"John Wick. Nobody expected the original to be so good that they made John Wick 2, 3, and 4."
"Great, Matt won&#39;t watch Death Note, but he&#39;s happy to dive into Joker 2..."
Empire. Strikes. Back.
Terrible date night movie
It could be an agenda to ruin the movie but it could just as easily be incompetence. Its pretty common to for filmmakers to have absolutely no idea whaly their movie was a hit in the first place. And todd phillips isnt some great filmmaker. Its most likely that he just lucked into a hit and didnt know what it even was about. So this is just a return to the mean for him.
"I knew what going to happen going in and I thought the movie was much better going in‚Ä¶   I like to imagine that this was the Heath Ledger joker ass a much younger man‚Ä¶ knowing gave me a different perspective going in‚Ä¶ the first was a great movie, but this was also good on its own right‚Ä¶ I enjoyed the twist in the end‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"this is why i don&#39;t even consider a movie until after The Critical Drinker has reviewed it, you see...<br>how did they think gaslighting the pain of literally every person who saw themselves reflected in the first movie would work out"
Top Gun 2 was a great sequel.  I don‚Äôt think it was pre planned.
"The first was enjoyable.  I heard the second..sucks, i guess they were right."

What a disaster! Reflects the total exhaustion of artistic creativity in Hollywood.

"When someone says &quot;everyone&#39;s heard of it&quot;, and I have not heard of it, I am unsure whether I live under a rock or it&#39;s just them living in a bubble."
Warner Bros and Todd Phillips made Joker 2 bad on purpose.
"&quot;Megalopolis&quot; was actually a masterpiece. Matt-if you feel that Hollywood just makes stupid films-this is the opposite. It bombed because it was too smart for the bulk of the audience. It is somewhat of a quiet, muddled movie, (the voices are too quiet) but if you can make out what they are saying, it is a campy, frenetic masterpiece. There are genius quotes in there. Watch it!"
"1) Arthur Fleck was too weak and whiny and not intelligent enough to be the actual Joker.¬†<br>2) The arc of the movie was not bad. Let&#39;s get rid of this loser, so the real Joker can come forth<br>3) ...forget the musical¬†<br>4) ...forget Lady Gaga.¬† She&#39;s average looking and slightly corpulent<br>5) Many women have hybristophilia (attracted to violent men). It is on a continuum between spanking and serial killers. A man must be able to handle situations.<br>6) Typically, women don&#39;t love men for interests, morality, ethics.... just what they accomplish.¬† In this case, fame &amp; violence.¬†<br>7) Doppelgangers... if you&#39;re going to have a psycho girl, then don&#39;t make her Harley Quinn, since Arthur Fleck was not the Joker. There are plenty of women with hybristophilia."
Maybe ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù
WHEN THEY SAID LADY GAGA WAS GOING TO BE IN IT I KNEW IT WOULD BOMB üí£ BIG TIME üòâ
This is the most expensive trolling attempt ever
Toy Story 2 &amp; 3 are both sequels that weren‚Äôt planned that were also highly successful üëÄ
The 2nd Ace Ventura was absolutely lit and better than the 1st one.
"Best sequel, that id argue, was unplanned, is EASILY, The Empire Strikes Back."
"The &quot;remake&quot; sequel can work for Action and Comedy movies.<br>The Hangover movies are very gag driven and not plot driven.  Just situation after situation loosely connected and slowly pushing forward towards the conclusion. <br>Taken and John Wick are the same in the Action genre.<br><br>If laughing or fight scenes are what people came for, then the story doesn&#39;t matter as much.<br>With Drama the plot is all that matters, so no one wants a retelling"
Aliens is a good example of a good sequel. It didn&#39;t even have the same directors.
JOKER WHY TODD PHILLIPS CAN SUCK IT THE FIRST JOKER WAS A MASTERPIECE WHY ?
Terrifier 3 coming in hot like Hunter Biden in a third world country
"What most audiences assumed they would see was the gradual decline and disappearance of Arthur Fleck and the rise of the Joker. Instead, the director apparently sabotaged the film itself to destroy and deconstruct both the protagonist character and the first film to punish the audience for having interpreted him &quot;incorrectly.&quot;"
Because the world is going through allot of crap and people are tired of the movie industry banking off our suffering.  Bread and circus isn‚Äôt working anymore.  Folks are waking up.
Terminator 2 and the Two Towers (LOTRs) were very successful sequels.  Conan the Destroyer (Conan 2) maybe not so much....but I liked it.
A hundred years isn‚Äôt a long time historically speaking. That‚Äôs how long it took most people to realize the vanity of celebrity.
It had every indication of being a stinker when they released trailers completely devoid of the &quot;musical&quot; aspect. Intentionally misleading and a total blindside for the uninitiated who were expecting a normal sequel.

What were they THINKING making this a musical?
I actually really liked the movie.
I enjoyed the story in Joker 1 that explored one man&#39;s struggles with mental illness. A memorable scene was him dancing down the stairs and it became a fan favorite. The studio saw that and decided &#39;let&#39;s give them more of that&#39; and made Joker 2 a musical and deconstructed all the progress that the Joker made in the first movie. Horrible movie that shouldn&#39;t have been made.
&quot;Lady&quot; Gaga being in it alone is reason enough to never see this movie.
I&#39;ll wait for streaming
"Terminator 2 and Aliens were both unplanned, and are both among the greatest action movies of all time. Of course they were both made by James Cameron, who is a movie and money making machine, so...."
"Without even watching it, I just feel the pretentiousness."
"I like all the defenders of the director saying things like &quot;he predicted the financial failure&quot; and stuff like everything regarding a criticism of the the movie and saying it was &quot;intentional&quot;. <br><br>Cope to the max.<br><br>If someone liked the movie, cool. From the first trailer I saw, I just felt like it looked like pretentious crap."
"Walsh obviously believe that his own audience is dumb, including too stupid to know the term &quot;folie a deux.&quot;. (A mental delusion shared by two very close people, such as a husband and wife.)"
"Hard pass, will never watch."
Joker 2 is a masterpiece. The comic book nerds are just mad about the twist at the end.
Empire strikes back was a sequel that was only made because of how succesful the first Star Wars film was
Terminator 2 wasn&#39;t planned and is better than the original. JS...

"I liked the first one, but there was one huge problem. Not knocking Phoenix performance but he&#39;s too old looking for the timeline. He&#39;s a great joker but if Bruce Wayne is a child, joker can&#39;t be like 50. Sequal was just trying to be a cash grab. Nothing about it was any good."
Thank you for watching so we don‚Äôt have to.
I can pronounce &quot;Folie a deux&quot; and I&#39;m not even French.
Give a movie review for Megalopolis.  What a letdown that was.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=206"">3:26</a> I know Matt thinks it‚Äôs overrated, but ‚ÄòThe Dark Knight‚Äô is technically a sequel to ‚ÄòBatman Begins‚Äô. Warner Brothers made doing a sequel a priority after the success of the first one. So I think that is a good example of a sequel that was on-par or exceeded the first movie in its series, though I recognize that those are rare."
"The only people who I‚Äôve seen who say they like it are morons who say ‚ÄúI LOVED it, because only incels liked the first one, and this one pissed off the incels!‚Äù<br><br>Imagine liking a movie strictly for vindictive purposes, because you‚Äôve decided to hate everyone who likes the first one. Same people who shriek about ‚ÄúToXiC fAnDoM!!‚Äù too"
"In my opinion, the 2nd best sequel of all time [ The God Father II being #1] is Predator 2. Heck this film even had a race swap!!.. Hands down though, Danny Glover did a phenomenal job in bringing this epic masterpiece of action horror to greatness! Still to this day I cannot recall enjoying a sequel as much as Predator 2.  Honorable mentions to Empire Strikes Back and Aliens 2."
Back to the Future!
"The Empire Strikes Back was an unplanned, yet highly successful and well respected sequel."
"Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re still the #1 Joker!"
It‚Äôs not the Joker! Some BS
I‚Äôm really sorry you had to sit through that Matt. Thanks for taking one for the team. I wish I could see your movie here in Australia.
Does anybody know if Matt reviewed the first one. Matt is kind of a stick in the mud. The first one was good.
"I don&#39;t know , I still Cesar Romero , as the Joker ..."
I&#39;m not sure The Dark Knight was planned. The joker card hinted but it was never official.
I don&#39;t think Terminator 2 was planned before the first one and it was far superior.
"This sounds like the Marvel movies.  They were initially so fantastic with Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, etc...  Then after Endgame, the Marvel movies morphed into Thor needing to be saved by his girlfriend.  Not what the Marvel audience wants to watch."

Two or three well-done scenes to show us the inner-workings of the Joker&#39;s mind? Ok, I can live with that. But like a dozen that make me check the time halfway through the movie? That&#39;s insane. <br><br>If you just edited-out the musical shit, it&#39;s an infinitely better movie that ends weirdly."
"Does anyone remember Prometheus? It was a prequel to Alien, directed by Ridley Scott. It was so horrendous I had to stop watching it! Perhaps I was intellectually inept and I couldn‚Äôt understand it! But, be that as it may, if you start making prequels, and that point you have become desperate for an audience and second had acclaim!"
"Aliens, Terminator 2 both examples Matt missed and miserably so.  Come on Matt step up your game."
"I‚Äôm throughly sickened by the libs of holly wood, most especially Gaga, so nah, I‚Äôll pass."
Terminator 2 was a great sequel but only because it&#39;s actually a documentary.
Do the musical numbers have that kitchie pop Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift sing? If it does then I ain&#39;t going to see it.
There are people that get paid to evaluate movies. Often they have never made a movie. These individuals are called ‚Äúcritics‚Äù. Trolls may need to live and absorb knowledge or drink less alcohol during the day‚Ä¶.LOL
And watch...it&#39;ll get the Best Picture award.
&quot;I watched the new Joker....&quot;<br>Your first mistake.
I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt waste my time &amp; money . üëé
I agree with Matt. On top of that it&#39;s hard to get a script to a literary agent or producer so they stick within their crap bubble of shallow minds.
"Matt, now that the fake Pope declared that the fake Catholic church blesses homosexual relationships will you leave the transvestites alone?"
Thanks now i don&#39;t have to watch it. Walsh you are awesome keep it up
I assume they wanted this to tank so as to prevent so-called incels to start murdering people like the Joker‚Ä¶Or hubris. üòÇ
James Cameron is my go to example of unplanned sequels actually working out. <br>Terminator 2 and Aliens were both wildly successful sequels.
"T2 was the exception <br><br>This joker had the potential to be the best movie joker. Phoenix has the look and the skills to pull it off. All they needed to do was continue the story ark of the first film, it&#39;s the anti establishment film. That showed how bureaucracy is the problem the top is Always filled with uncaring selfish people who in a twisted mind deserves nothing good along with those who allow it to be that way. <br><br>If you put the joker into the system and make a total copy of the mad pierrot episode of cowboy bebob and have the budding caring connection between harley quinnzell and Arthur fleck where she actually is trying to help him. But have the crooked system put fleck threw a program (because he has no one to defend him). I&#39;d have introduced  Dr Hugo strange as a nameless person that&#39;s like a fauchi evil type of character on steroids (you know the type that will run the nation through hell just because it couldn&#39;t hurt and making millions on being crooked funding programs to kill millions that&#39;s deeply connected  to the shady bureaucrats in power type). And copy Pierrot Le Fou story changing  fleck to the joker. <br><br>Omgoodness Phoenix would&#39;ve been terrific and have that switch of being fun to absolutely terrifying, funny deadly and completely without any morals, sympathy or empathy of any type. The fans would love it but because it&#39;s against the comunist creed of worship the leader and love the bureaucrats. But the media would have hated it because they are Marxist, fascist. But you&#39;d have another billion dollar movie on your hands and a new joker that be a perfect fit to THE BATMAN universe<br><br>Note the Pierrot Le Fou episode of cowboy bebop was fashioned closely after batman the animated series because the artist worked on both shows."
"Does Lady Gaga have the same promotional team as Kumala Harris?  I ask because although neither appears to enjoy any popularity in their own right, we&#39;re constantly being told that our life is incomplete without them..."
The moment we knew Lady Gaga was there we can tell it was ruined.
Yet I had no idea this movie existed. ‚ÄúCable cutting‚Äù has it‚Äôs benefits.
They purposively made the movie bad to undermine the following the 1st movie created - they didn&#39;t want an incel white man who rebels against the establishment to be hailed as an anti-hero.
Terminator 2? ü§î
"Even the first movie was a <b>**</b> up.<br>Sure, it was great in a way.<br>But the way that it was great... seemed to have been totally by accident.<br>So there was no hope for a sequel."
"Well, this cancellation was rather redundant... n&#39;est-ce pas?"
"Godfather went back and told The Godfather&#39;s back story the rest were trash. Then, after the first Alien movie, the other 7 were prequels to prequels ridiculous."
You watched it so I don&#39;t have to too ....thanks for taking one for the team dude
"The money spent ONLY on Todd, Joaquin and Gaga was nearly the budget for the first movie. That is insane behavior IMO. So they are already burning profits by doing that. They could each have had half that much and that would still be more money than any of them need. Then you have the fact that nothing about the movie was exciting. Why would they not make Joker and Harley get broken out by the fans of Joker and have them rampage in Gotham? It frankly boggles the mind how little creativity it would have taken to make this movie good, with half the budget."
Toy Story 2 is the exception to the rule. Also Aliens...and maybe Terminator 2?
We need Matt on Nerdrotic<br><br>Come on people let&#39;s make it happen<br>Spread the word
"I was so disappointed i was left in limbo for a few days later, what a complete let down, it uad the potential to be great but it was just shit !"
Road Warrior was better than Mad Max. Not a box office juggernaut but an improvement on the original.
I never even heard any advertisement for this movie. I liteeallyhadni idea there was gonna be a Joker 2. Its their own fault the movie flopped. Smh
probably the dark governments way of funneling a lot of money into things like elections and other projects
Can you review the show the penguin
"Matt Walsh should make &quot;What is a woman 2&quot; and &quot;Am I Racist 2&quot;. Easy cash printing machine. No I kid but when Hollywood does that it&#39;s so annoying. Let a series end, they need to create new stories."
"Too bad, they could have done so much with it."
"Quinn is meant to be so mentally broken she fell in love with a serial killer inmate who repeatedly beats her to a pulp and throws away her career for him.  <br>Do you think Gaga would be willing to look like a beaten pulp on the ground crying &quot;I love you&quot; as the Joker stands over her laughing?<br><br>If not, she was not a suitable actor for the role"
The title means the folly of two.
Almost perfectly named. Correct title: A double folly and joke.
Aliens (the second Alien movie) was a sequel that was better than the first movie.
"I was going to save this comment for after Joker 3 but since it looks like that won‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôll make it now. Jaws 3 starring Lou Gossett Jr and D. Quaid where Jaws breaks into Seaworld is the best Jaws of the series. Also, Rocky 3 starring Mr T and Hulk Hogan is by far the best Rocky. Carry On."
<b>What is a Folie a Deux?</b> ü§î <br><br><b>Am I a Folie a Deux?</b> ü§î
I disagree. I believe the majority of movies and TV shows DO contain a message that resonates with the writers in each case. It&#39;s a heavily Marxist message.
Your review is the same as everyone elses what a surprise.
"Heres my take, the Main actor ran his mouth like a woke tosser.<br>So its a boycott from me"
"&quot;Folie o Deux&quot; must be a double entandre for how making a part 2 to the successful &quot;Joker&quot; film was a fools errand and a mass delusion among the producers who thought they could force the original team to do it again. Everything about Joker 2  is about the rejection of the character Joker being able to outdo his first outing where he executed a man on live television, though they setup perfectly a scenario where he could; Joker&#39;s trial could have been something akin to Ted Bundy&#39;s trial, where he even fired his lawyer and represented himself. Had Arthur/Joker taken over the court house with his mob of Joker fans and broadcasted the execution of the judge and jury on live television then escaped, he would have become the &quot;Joker&quot; proper, with his gang of loyal thugs explained beautifully and his title as the clown prince of crime officially bequeathed. However instead of that payoff to the obvious setup, they instead decided to make Arthur reject his identity as the Joker and get shanked for it. What?"
Ocean‚Äôs 12?
Not a review dude
"I was really looking forward to it, Joker was just wonderful, I loved it! But didn‚Äôt see the sequel bc it was touted as a musical although the trailer was fabulous, and usually I‚Äôm totally fooled by the trailers I‚Äôm ashamed to say!"
"You sound so ridiculous when you say ‚Äúthe movie hates its fans‚Äù. Honestly, grow up."
This joker film certain is a joke and a very bad one at that
Home alone 2 was pretty good
Aliens is a good sequel
"This movie should be forgotten forever. Completely destroys the first movie and attacks the fans. People who liked the 2nd movie doesn&#39;t understand, we like the 1st movie because he was Arthur fleck, not comic book joker. Arthur was &quot;a joker&quot; not &quot;the joker&quot;"
"There was no spoiler warning in this, and yet I don&#39;t really care."
"I&#39;m generally bored by DC, and especially by the Batman world itself, so I will likely never watch either of those movies.  I did however, read the plot summaries out of curiosity, and I really like the subversion of audience expectations and I thought the introduction of the joker is clever. If you enjoy that property, look at the bright side."
&quot;What is a man&quot; will be better
Best sequels ever will always be T2 and Aliens. Period üòë
Aliens
Aliens was as good as the original Alien .... so there!
"This movie was made for us chuds and incels. It&#39;s a waring to us: &quot;Don&#39;t you dare get out of line. Don&#39;t you dare act out or rise up against the society that, at best, treats you like a stray dog. You&#39;ll be thrown in the nut house and given the ol&#39; &#39;grape and shank&#39; treatment.&quot;"
Aliens. That‚Äôs the exception to the rule
I think cultural penetration is a liberal term.
I wonder how much of it simply has to do with so many people becoming do disenchanted with Big Media and their near-total Leftist bent?
Aliens and Terminator 2 are great sequels that weren&#39;t part of the original storyline.
Matt such a huge fact checker but FAILED to  mention the several real factors why this movie was Dogshit.<br>The movie idea came to Joaquin in a dream <br>Todd Philips has complete control of the movie<br>Rejected notes giving by James Gunn who probably could&#39;ve saveddl the movie because James is pretty damn good at his job with comic book movies and has proven that. There&#39;s more but you failed to mention those .....
"When the director makes a thriller into a musical because his difficult A list main wants it that way, that‚Äôs a recipe for failure."
The people who would make this film a box office success just don‚Äôt have the money.
"The way too much singing (to the point of it being qualified for the musical section shelf space) and her ridiculous lip injections (that weren‚Äôt even around back then) ruined it for me. It wayyyy too much about the lady, and not joker stuff."
A Quiet Place 2 was an outlier.
"It was terrible and if they were trying to offend the viewers of the first movie, fuck em. Who cares. It will flop and that‚Äôs how it goes."
They&#39;re not making films for profit like they&#39;re not waging wars to &quot;win&quot;... the process is the product.Moving capital around is the point.
"I loved the original Joker. I&#39;m not going to watch this movie ever, even on streaming."
Joker 2: Forcing √° Deuce üí©
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYdAwMw37xw&amp;t=167"">2:47</a> ‚ÄúSequels that are not planned, that the filmmaker did not have in mind, that were only conceived after the fact as a way of capitalizing on the unexpected success of the original film, those sequels are terrible in literally every case. I cannot think of an outlier or an exception to the rule. Maybe there is one,but I, y‚Äônow, it‚Äôs hard to think of one.‚Äù<br><br>‚ÄúAliens‚Äù comes to mind. Also, I don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúThe Road Warrior‚Äù was an originally planned sequel, but that‚Äôs off the top of my head."
Terminator 2‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs your example.
"Knew it would be bad when they said it would be a musical, which was reinforced further by the poor trailer. I call it Foley a la Deuce."
Didn‚Äôt know about the joker movie but I knew about yours and can‚Äôt wait to watch it.
The movie sucks. It&#39;s an attack on the first movie and all the fans who liked it. A massive disappointment!
He never fights batman. It&#39;s actually Clown the movie with lucrative batman paint to sell it
Early life check on Todd Phillips...
"I guess it wasn&#39;t Gaga, ooh-la-la after all üòÇ. the first movie was fine as that the first and only movie for joker it easily could&#39;ve been left as it was and led into Batman especially since you can see the waynes getting mugged in the end of the first one while Joker drives by."
"&quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;<br>&quot;Rocky III&quot;<br>&quot;Aliens&quot;<br>There are some really good sequels, from 35+ years ago."
Who would have guessed making a movie that hates its fans would not be successful?
Secret of the Ooze. I rest my case.
The last &quot;new&quot; movie I saw when it came out was the first  Star Wars sequal prequal.
"Or, maybe, the purpose of the film isn‚Äôt what you assume it‚Äôs supposed to be."
Do prequels count?
"The audience that enjoyed the original Joker, who enjoyed sympathizing with the dark, twisted origin story of the first...are not the musical theatre audience"
&quot;Joker 2 sucks.&quot; - Matt Walsh
As soon as I saw that Lady Gaga is going to be in it‚Äî i knew it would be shit
"Even if Joker 2 fails, the studio still made $1B on the first movie.  The studio still made a great deal of money, just less."
"I actually thought it was ok. Not nearly as good as the first one, but I&#39;m not mad that I saw it üòä"
"These superhero Movies don&#39;t need to make money, It&#39;s just assumed people are going to sit impressionable Youths infront of them for years to come, implanting their ideology into the kids who watch them for years to come."
"Apart from James Bond, people get sick of the same character after a while."
Terminator 2? Aliens?
Matt Walsh has ruined all other movies when he became an incredible actor and director.
How bout Batman Dark knight?
The second Jurassic Park movie (The Lost World) was unplanned but actually pretty good. (The third one was terrible though)
"Terminator 2 is an excellent sequel, but now I have to wonder if James Cameron already had a sequel planned even before the first Terminator was released.(of course all the Terminator movies after that sucked, probably because James Cameron has little to no involvement in them)"
"I liked the part where it made no sense whatsoever, pandered, and didnt even need to be made. Wait, i hated that. Actually, i didn&#39;t even see it. Still hated it."
"Just another example of chasing money by piggybacking off of a prior success. If something works, people cannot resist riding the shit out of it until its hated by the public, due to completely unnecessary longevity. There is nothing done for art anymore, its now all algorithms and squeezing every possible penny.<br><br>We didnt need a billion star wars spinoffs with pathetic high school level dialogue, or 100000 marvel films with budgets higher than the GDP of Rwanda. One film like October Sky or Prince of Egypt is worth a thousand of these lifeless sequels."
Top Gun Maverick was an exception to the rule - A masterpiece - best sequala ever - stats/money prove it
Matt talkin like a boss because he just released an all time classic that crushed the box office
"matt walsh is part of the problem, the problem of if you challenge his position you dont get a voice. They moderate the comments, dont criticize ben shapiro"
Who wants to see lady gaga act üòÇüòÖ
"I really enjoyed it. Not as good as the original, but definitely worth a watch."
Shrek 2 is the exception
Every film now just seems to be an even worse sequel of the previously bad sequel its as if they have completely run out of ideas so they keep churning out this sort of garbage
I called it‚Äôd suck from the jump while everyone was hyped
"Have no intention of seeing it. Should have been left alone as a solo movie.. everything needs a sequel now, everything needs to be part of a cinematic universe."
hello im crew! just wanted to say I think your stuff is funny as fuck and I love to learn information from this channel! also your movie rocked!
First and yes - it&#39;s a flop
More like folie a doo doo
