Data Clusters
-->Association: relation b'w 2 variables
-->Dependence: how the variable is depended on the other
-->Corelation: measure of dependency in form
-->Causation: 
-->Co-Variance: If one variable changes, the other one changes too
-->Simpson Paradox: If a single group of data proves one trend, but when taken a large group of data, the trend will be wrong
-->Clustering Techniques: 

Data Testing: 
-->Parametric Testing: Testing the data based on the distributions if known
-->Non Parametric: Quite opp to parametric
-->A/B Testing: testing in a controlled environment
-->Chi Square Testing: determine a significant relation b'w 2 categorized variables

Regression: finding the best way to draw a line (or a curve) through a bunch of data points to help you predict something or understand the relationship between things.
-->Linear regression: relationship b/w dependent & independent variables in a linear eqn (y=mx+c)
-->Logistic regression: classification b/w components (generally yes or no, lies b/w the limit or not etc.,)
-->Colinearity: 
-->Residual: difference b/w actual & observed value
-->Residual analysis: Hetero & Homo
