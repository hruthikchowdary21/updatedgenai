1. Parametric Testing
Parametric testing is used when data follows a known distribution, usually assuming the data is normally distributed.

Example: An insurance company wants to compare the average healthcare costs between two groups: people under 50 and those over 50. They assume that the healthcare costs in each group follow a normal distribution. Using t-tests (a type of parametric test), they compare whether there is a statistically significant difference in the average healthcare costs between the two age groups.

2. Non-Parametric Testing
Non-parametric testing is used when data doesn't necessarily follow a known distribution, making it more flexible for non-normal datasets.

Example: An insurance company wants to evaluate customer satisfaction scores for two different healthcare plans (Plan A and Plan B). They have gathered ratings from many policyholders, but they notice that the ratings don't follow a normal distributionâ€”they're skewed. The company can use a Mann-Whitney U test (a non-parametric test) to compare the satisfaction scores of the two plans without assuming a particular data distribution.

3. A/B Testing
A/B testing is used to compare two versions of something to determine which performs better.

Example: The health insurance company wants to see which version of a new promotional email gets more customers to sign up for a preventive care plan. They randomly split the customer base into two groups:

Group A receives Email Version A with a certain format and tone.
Group B receives Email Version B with a different format and tone. After a week, the company compares the response rates between the two groups to determine which version led to more sign-ups. The better-performing email will be used for a wider rollout.
4. Chi-Square Testing
Chi-square testing is used to see if there is an association between categorical variables.

Example: An insurance company wants to see if there is a relationship between having a chronic condition (like diabetes) and the type of health insurance plan chosen (basic vs. premium). They gather data and organize it into a contingency table:

Column 1: Number of people with and without diabetes who chose the basic plan.
Column 2: Number of people with and without diabetes who chose the premium plan. The company uses a chi-square test to determine whether there is a significant association between having a chronic condition and selecting a specific type of health insurance plan.
These layman examples illustrate how these statistical testing techniques can be applied in the healthcare insurance domain to gain insights, make decisions, and improve services.
